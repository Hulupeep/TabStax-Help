# <img src="icons/tabstax-48.png" alt="TabStax" width="48" height="48" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 10px;">Welcome to TabStax Help

Welcome 👋
This is your home base for understanding how TabStax works and how to stay in flow with it.

TabStax isn't "just another tab manager."
It's a **flow manager**.

It groups all the sites you use to get something done — documentation, dashboards, tools, videos, briefs, email, boards — and combines them with your **next actions** and a little **context**. One click, and you're back where your mind left off.

And not just you....you're entire team, with Tabstax sharing.

## The problem TabStax solves

Every time you return to a project, you **rebuild context from scratch**: reopen tabs, re-find docs, try to remember "what was I doing here?" Your brain loops on unfinished work, burning through working memory just to hold it all together. There's no natural way to package that context—tabs, resources, next actions—into one named place you can trust.

**TabStax is built on behavioral psychology**. It works with how your brain actually wants to work: externalizing context, defining clear next actions, and freeing your working memory for actual thinking instead of remembering.

## What you'll find here

TabStax  is designed to answer one simple question:

> “What do I need to know right now to get back into flow?”

Over time, this help center will grow into a small set of clear guides, including:

* **Getting started**
  * [What problem TabStax solves](topics/what_problem_tabstax_solves.md) – the core problem and mindset shift
  * [What you see the first time you open TabStax](topics/first_time_opening_tabstax.md) – your first experience after installing
  * [The TabStax Mental Model](topics/tabstax_mental_model.md) – the big idea: think in problems, not tabs
  * [What is a Stax?](topics/what_is_a_stax.md) – understand the core concept
  * [Creating your first Stax](topics/creating_your_first_stax.md) – step-by-step guide with a real example
* **Working with Stax**
  * [Understanding the main popup](topics/using_the_main_popup.md) – navigate next actions and open Stax
* **Sharing and collaboration** – what it means when someone shares a Stax with you, and how to safely use shared Stax.
* **Accounts and sync** – using TabStax locally without an account, or signing in to sync Stax across devices.
* **Safety and privacy** – what TabStax can see, what it cannot see, and how to treat Stax links safely.
* **Troubleshooting** – common issues and how to fix them quickly.

You don’t need to read everything. Dip in when something feels confusing or when you want to get more out of Stax.

## If you're new to TabStax

If you've just installed the extension or landed here for the first time:

* Think of TabStax as a set of **named workspaces** for your brain.
* Each workspace is a **Stax**: a bundle of tabs plus next actions and context.
* Instead of reopening random tabs and trying to remember what you were doing, you open the Stax and step back into the same mental room.

Start simple: pick one project, save the tabs you use for it as a Stax, add a couple of next actions, and use that as your "home base" for that piece of work.

**Want to understand the core idea?** → [What problem TabStax solves](topics/what_problem_tabstax_solves.md) explains the mindset shift
**Just installed?** → [What you see the first time you open TabStax](topics/first_time_opening_tabstax.md) explains your first screen
**Ready to try it?** → [Creating your first Stax](topics/creating_your_first_stax.md)

## If someone shared a Stax with you

If you arrived here because someone sent you a Stax:

* They’ve captured the way they work on something into a single shared space.
* Opening that Stax lets you stand in the same place: same structure, same tabs, same context.
* You can treat it like a curated bundle of links built around one purpose.

As with any link someone sends you, you should only fully trust Stax from people or sources you trust. You can always scan the domains and open a few tabs first before opening everything.

## Staying in flow

TabStax is built around one core idea:

> Your brain should spend its energy doing the work, not reconstructing where you were.

This help center is here to support that.
If you’re stuck, confused, or curious, the goal of every article here is to:

* Explain things in simple mental models
* Show you how to get back to a working state quickly
* Help you use Stax as the central “room” where your work happens, not just a list of tabs
