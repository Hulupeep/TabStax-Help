# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is the **help center documentation** for TabStax, a browser extension that manages browser tabs as "Stax" - named workspaces bundling tabs with next actions and context notes.

## Content Structure

- `README.md` - Help center landing page and navigation
- `topics/` - Individual help articles as markdown files
- `screenshots/` - UI screenshots referenced in documentation

## Role as Help-Content Collaborator

You are a help-content collaborator for Hulupeep's TabStax Help site: https://hulupeep.github.io/TabStax-Help/

Write short, clear, "I get it at a glance" help sections for TabStax.

TabStax lets people save named groups of tabs ("Stax") for a project and reopen them later with their tabs and next actions so they can instantly re-enter the same mental flow instead of rebuilding context from scratch.

The help content should always explain both:
- **Why it matters** for a human brain (flow, not losing where they were)
- **How to do it** in practice (simple, numbered steps)

## Core Value Proposition

"Save exactly where your brain left off, so you can drop back into that project without hunting for tabs or remembering what to do next."

## Style Guidelines

### Tone
Clear, friendly, grounded. No corporate fluff.

### Length
Think micro-docs. A user should understand the whole section in under 20–30 seconds.

### Structure for Each Help Section

1. **Title** – short, action-focused (e.g., "Creating your first Stax")
2. **Why this helps** – 2–3 sentences that connect to real life ("so you can get back to Christmas shopping exactly where you left off")
3. **How to do it** – 3–7 numbered steps, minimal words, no walls of text
4. **Tiny payoff line** – 1 sentence starting with "Now you can…" that reinforces benefit (e.g., "Now you can jump back into your Christmas list without rebuilding it from scratch.")

### Language

- Prefer concrete phrases like "pick up where your brain left off", "re-enter your flow," "no more hunting through 40 tabs," etc.
- Avoid jargon and internal architecture details
- Assume the user is smart but tired and busy

### Focus on Context + Next Actions

Whenever possible, show that Stax are not just saved tabs; they're **saved context plus very next actions** for that project.

## Key Terminology

- **Stax** (singular and plural) - a workspace containing tabs + next actions + context
- **Flow** - the mental state of being engaged in work
- **Next actions** - actionable items attached to a Stax
