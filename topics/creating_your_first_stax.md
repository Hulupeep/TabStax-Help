# Creating your first Stax

## Why this helps

Christmas shopping means juggling tabs for Amazon, Etsy, wish lists, price comparisons, and gift ideas—all while trying to remember what you decided to buy for who. Close your browser or switch tasks, and that mental setup vanishes. You'll waste 10 minutes hunting through browser history and trying to remember "which Lego set was I comparing?" A Stax saves exactly where your brain left off, so you can drop back into Christmas shopping without rebuilding everything from scratch.

## How to do it

1. **Open some shopping tabs** – Pull up the sites you're using for Christmas shopping (Amazon, Etsy, gift guides, wish lists, etc.).

2. **Click the TabStax icon** in your browser toolbar (usually top-right corner).

3. **Name your Stax** – In the input field, type something like `Christmas Shopping 2025` or `santa #shopping #christmas` and click **New**.

4. **Your Start Page opens** – TabStax creates a home base for this shopping session.

5. **Add your very next actions** – In the text box at the top, type what you need to do next:
   - "Check kids' wish lists"
   - "Compare prices for Lego sets"
   - "Order gift for Mum"

   Press Enter after each one. These live right alongside your tabs.

6. **Close everything when you're done** – Your Stax is saved. All those tabs and next actions wait exactly where you left them.

7. **Reopen anytime** – Click TabStax, find "Christmas Shopping 2025" in "My Stax," and click it. Every tab reopens, and your next actions appear at the top.

## Now you can…

Now you can jump back into your Christmas shopping list without hunting through 15 tabs or trying to remember whether you'd already checked that basket in Amazon.
