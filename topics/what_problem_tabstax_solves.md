# What problem TabStax solves

The web has exploded into a million pages, but your actual work lives across many tabs and tools at once—not on a single website. Every time you return to a project, you rebuild context from scratch: reopen tabs, re-find docs, try to remember "what was I doing here?" There's no natural way to package all of that context—tabs, resources, half-formed thoughts—into one named place. TabStax changes that. You don't have to rebuild context anymore.

**TabStax exists because:**

* **You keep reopening the same tabs for the same project.** Amazon, Etsy, wish lists, price comparisons—every time you sit down to finish Christmas shopping, you start from zero.
* **Your work is spread across tools with no single entry point.** The brief is in Notion, the slide deck is in Google Slides, the data is in three dashboards, and you're holding it all in your head.
* **You can't easily show someone else the whole context.** When a teammate asks "what's the status?", you send five different links and hope they piece it together.
* **Rabbit holes burn time without producing a next action.** You research for an hour, close 30 tabs, and still don't know what to do first when you come back.
* **Unfinished projects loop in your mind.** Your brain keeps reminding you "don't forget that car insurance thing" because there's no external system you trust to hold it.
* **Context switching drains you.** Every mental rebuild—"Where was I? What tabs did I have open?"—costs attention and breaks flow.

## How you'll think differently

With TabStax, you shift from treating the web as individual sites to treating it as **problem spaces you can save and reopen**.

* **From thinking in websites** → to **thinking in problem spaces**. Not "I need that Amazon page," but "I need my Christmas Shopping workspace."
* **From rebuilding context** → to **reopening a named Stax with next actions**. One click and every tab, every resource, every next step is exactly where you left it.
* **From rabbit holes and endless research** → to **captured workspaces that end in a clear action**. You close the Stax knowing exactly what you'll do next time.
* **From solo mental load** → to **shareable entry points for collaborators**. Your teammate opens the same Stax and sees the same setup, same next actions, same context—no explanation needed.
* **From decision fatigue** → to **trusted external systems**. Your brain stops looping on "don't forget" because the Stax holds everything.

## Now you can…

Now you can stop rebuilding context and start reopening it—with one click, exactly where your brain left off.
