# Understanding the main TabStax popup

## Why this helps

When you're juggling multiple projects, your brain has to answer two questions: "What should I do next?" and "Which project should I open?" The main popup splits those questions into two clean sections so you can either follow the last thing you were working on, pick a different next action that matters more right now, or open a whole Stax when you're ready to dive in. No hunting through tabs or trying to remember which project needed what.

The **top bar** gives you quick access to Search, Feedback, Help, and Sign out. Below that, the popup has two main sections:

## My Next Actions

This is your cross-project brain inbox. It shows **three next actions** pulled from across all your Stax, sorted by **last updated**.

**What you'll see:**

* The **most recently updated** next action has a **soft pink glow** – a gentle nudge toward "this is probably what you were just working on."
* You're not locked into that choice; it's just a suggestion based on recency.

**What you can do:**

* **Click any next action** to jump to that Stax's **Start Page** – this opens the page where you can edit or review that Stax's next actions (it doesn't open all the tabs; just the Start Page).
* **See more next actions** in two ways:
  1. Click the **number** beside "My Next Actions" (e.g., `59`) to open a fuller list.
  2. Collapse the **My Next Actions** panel; when collapsed, a **"Browse all"** link appears. Click it to see a dashboard listing all projects and their next actions.

**Why this matters:**

Instead of asking yourself "What was I doing?" or "Which Stax had that thing I needed to finish?", you just glance at this section. Your brain can decide: follow the pink-highlighted recent action or pick something else that's more urgent right now.

## My Stax

This section is where you **open and manage whole Stax**. Use it when you're ready to dive into a full project with all its tabs.

**What you can do:**

* **Collapse or expand** the My Stax section to focus on either actions or your project list.
* Click the **dropdown** to see all your Stax.
* **Scroll and select** the Stax you want.
* Click **"Open All"** to open every tab in that Stax.
* Use the **search field** at the top to quickly find a Stax by name or hashtag (e.g., search `#clients` or `billing`).

**Creating a new Stax from this view:**

* In the Stax name field, type a name plus optional tags – for example, `cardano billing #clients`.
* Click **New**.
* The current set of tabs is saved as that Stax. Tags make it easier to find later.
* (For more detail, see [Creating your first Stax](creating_your_first_stax.md).)

## Now you can…

Now you can answer "What should I do next?" without digging through projects, and open the right Stax in one click when you're ready to work—no more rebuilding your setup or losing track of which project needed what.
