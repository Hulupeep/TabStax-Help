# Product Manager With Three Streams and a 15-Minute Gap

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You're a PM managing three parallel streams:

* **Stream A:** Mobile app redesign
* **Stream B:** API platform revamp
* **Stream C:** Analytics dashboard MVP

You have a 15-minute gap between two meetings, and you want to move something forward.

## Without TabStax

You open Slack, see 40 messages, start hunting for the Figma link, find an old version, get distracted by a Jira comment, lose the thread entirely.

## With TabStax

You've set up:

* **"PM – Mobile Redesign"** Stax
* **"PM – API Platform"** Stax
* **"PM – Analytics Dashboard"** Stax

Each Stax contains:

* PRD or spec doc
* Figma designs
* Jira board filtered to that stream
* Key Slack channel
* Stakeholder comms
* Start Page with:

  * *"Unblock design review"*
  * *"Follow up with eng on API spec"*

In 15 minutes:

* You open Mobile Redesign Stax.
* You see: Figma, PRD, and a note saying *"Ask Sarah to confirm timeline for handoff."*
* You send the message, check Jira, move on.

You **share each Stax with your cross-functional team**:

* Designers, engineers, and stakeholders open the same world when they work on that stream.

**Outcome:** Every spare minute becomes usable. You're not choosing between "figuring out what to work on" and "doing actual work."
