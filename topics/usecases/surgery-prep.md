# Preparing for Surgery in 4 Weeks

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

She's going in for surgery in a month.

Her world explodes into:

* Pre-op instructions (fasting, meds to stop, tests to do)
* Hospital portal
* Insurance/billing details
* Work: time off, handover docs
* Home: who will mind the kids, meals, transport to/from hospital
* Recovery: physio, equipment, follow-up visits

## Without TabStax

She prints some stuff, bookmarks other bits, and leaves emails starred. She wakes up at 3am thinking "Did I ever confirm who's picking me up?" and "When exactly do I stop taking that medication?"

## With TabStax

She creates **"Surgery – Operation & Recovery Plan"** Stax:

Tabs:

* Hospital portal and surgeon info
* Pre-op instructions PDF
* Insurance portal / coverage details
* Employer HR policy on medical leave
* Shared household Google Doc: *"While I'm in hospital & recovery"*
* List of recommended recovery equipment / physio exercises

Start Page split into **timelines**:

* **This Week:**

  * *"Book pre-op tests."*
  * *"Tell manager and confirm leave dates."*
* **Week Before:**

  * *"Stop medication X on [date]."*
  * *"Final check with hospital about admission time."*
* **After Surgery:**

  * *"Schedule first physio session."*
  * *"Review at-home care instructions with [partner/friend]."*

She **shares this Stax with her partner / key friend** and optionally a family member:

* They can see exactly what needs to happen when.
* They can add to the "While I'm in hospital" doc (meals, kid pickups, house stuff).

Now the surgery isn't just a date. It's a structured project with shared visibility.
When she gets scared, she opens the Stax and can tell: "I'm actually doing what needs to be done."
