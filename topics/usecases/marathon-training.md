# Bill, 240lbs, Training for His First Marathon

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

Bill is 240lbs and has decided: *I'm running a marathon this year.*
Not to "get skinny". To prove to himself he can.

His world now has:

* Beginner marathon training plans
* YouTube videos on form
* Articles on running at higher weight
* Shoe and gear reviews
* A calendar mapping out long runs
* Nutrition and recovery guides

## Without TabStax

He keeps googling the same stuff. Training plans in one tab, shoe reviews in another, a random blog post open on his phone. He forgets which plan he chose. Every time he thinks "I should train" he has to rebuild the universe.

## With TabStax

He builds **"Bill – Marathon 2025"** Stax:

* The **one training plan** he chose
* A shoe store tab with his shortlist
* A spreadsheet logging runs
* A YouTube playlist: "Running Form & Recovery"
* A calendar showing the 16–20 week build
* Start Page with:

  * *"This week's long run: 5 miles on Saturday."*
  * *"Next Action TODAY: 20-minute easy run + 5 minutes form drills."*

He **shares this Stax with his running buddy / partner / accountability friend**:

* They see his plan.
* They can drop comments ("I added a link about knee-friendly strength work.").

Every time doubt creeps in, the task is simple: **open the Marathon Stax**.

* The plan
* The progress
* The "why"

…all load at once. He's not restarting the project every time he laces up — he's continuing a story.
