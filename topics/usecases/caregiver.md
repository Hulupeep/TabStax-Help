# Caregiver for an Ageing Parent, Managing Medical, Legal, and Daily Life

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

He's the "responsible child" for his ageing mum.

His world:

* GP and specialist portals
* Medication lists
* Lab results
* Legal docs (power of attorney, will)
* Home care providers
* Benefits and pension info
* Siblings' WhatsApp thread with opinions

## Without TabStax

Every new issue — a fall, a new prescription, a letter about benefits — sends him back into the mess. He hunts for which login goes where, which doctor said what, and how that aligns with the legal stuff. Siblings ask questions he can't quickly answer without repeating a 20-minute search.

## With TabStax

He defines **"Mum – Health & Life Admin"** Stax:

* GP portal tab
* Specialist clinic portal
* Medications tracking sheet
* Folder with scans of legal docs
* Benefits/pension portal
* A running "Timeline & Notes" doc
* Start Page:

  * *"Last updates: new blood pressure meds, physio referral."*
  * *"Next Actions: schedule follow-up, check side effects, call benefits office about letter."*

He **shares this Stax with his siblings** (with passwords handled via manager, not in-stax, obviously).

Now when the benefits letter arrives or the doctor calls:

* He opens that Stax.
* Takes notes *in one place*.
* Siblings can open the Stax and self-serve: "Oh, she already had that scan; here's the date."

The caregiving load is still heavy. But the cognitive retrieval tax is much lighter.
