# Public Defender in LA, 100 Degrees, Court in 10 Minutes

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

It's Los Angeles, 3:20pm, 100 degrees.
He's in his car outside the courthouse, laptop balanced on the steering wheel, AC fighting for its life.

In 10 minutes, he's standing in front of a judge on **People v. Ramirez**. Before that, he was working on two other cases in completely different states of chaos:

* A plea negotiation on **People v. Johnson**
* A bail review on **People v. Flores**

Each case lives in its own mess:

* Court docket
* Discovery PDFs
* Notes from last client meeting
* Email from DA
* Motion draft
* Sentencing guideline references

## Without TabStax

His browser is 40 tabs deep. Ramirez motion draft is somewhere. The DA's last email is buried. The docket link? Who knows. Sweat, literal and metaphorical. He goes into court with "good enough" recall and hopes he doesn't miss something crucial.

## With TabStax

He's already set up:

* **"Case – People v. Ramirez"** Stax
* **"Case – People v. Johnson (Plea)"**
* **"Case – People v. Flores (Bail Review)"**

Ramirez Stax includes:

* The case in the LA court portal
* The motion draft
* Email thread with the DA
* Notes from his last jail visit
* A tab with relevant statute / guidelines
* Start Page with bold Next Actions:

  * *"Argue for continuance if DA's offer unchanged"*
  * *"Bring up missing discovery from 03/14"*

He **shares the Ramirez Stax with his investigator and paralegal** earlier in the week:

* Investigator adds a tab with a key witness statement.
* Paralegal adds a timeline doc and a checklist.

Sitting in the baking car now, he hits **Open Stax → Ramirez**.

* The docket is right there
* The motion is open to the last paragraph he edited
* His notes remind him: *"Client wants to avoid any plea with strike implications; confirm understanding of risk on record."*

He closes Johnson and Flores worlds. For these 10 minutes, his whole brain is Ramirez.
When his case is called, he walks in hot, but not scattered — his environment did the remembering for him.
