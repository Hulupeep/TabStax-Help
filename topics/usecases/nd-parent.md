# ND Parent With School Chaos and Shared Mental Load

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You've got a child in school and the usual mess:

* School app / portal
* Emails about trips, uniforms, events
* Payment links
* Calendar of random one-off days
* A running checklist of "things to remember for Thursday"

## Without TabStax

Stuff slips. One parent ends up carrying all the mental load. You scramble the morning of the school play.

## With TabStax

You create **"Rory – School Admin (This Term)"** Stax:

* School portal
* Payment pages
* Shared Google Doc: "School To-Dos"
* Calendar in the right view

Start Page Next Actions:

* *"Pay for class trip – deadline Fri"*
* *"Buy new tracksuit bottoms"*
* *"Note parent-teacher time slot"*

You **share this Stax with your co-parent**.

Now:

* Either of you can open the Stax and see everything that needs attention.
* Whoever acts just ticks off the next action and updates the doc.
* On big days (school play, sports day), you open the Stax and instantly see the logistics instead of sweeping through old emails.

**Outcome:** The mental model of "school admin" becomes a shared workspace, not one person's overloaded memory.
