# Mum With a Son Who Has Special Needs – The Call From the School

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

She's at the kitchen table, finally trying to get some work done, when her phone rings.

It's the school.
Her son melted down in class. There was an incident. They want a meeting tomorrow.

Her world for this child already spans:

* School portal
* IEP / support plan
* Email from the SENCO, occupational therapist, psychologist
* Government benefits portal
* Autism/ADHD resources she trusts
* Her own notes from past meetings

## Without TabStax

Every incident is a fresh storm. She scrambles: searching her inbox, opening the wrong report, hunting for the last IEP, trying to remember what they promised last time. By the time she's in the meeting, she's reactive and exhausted.

## With TabStax

She already has **"[Child's Name] – School & Supports"** Stax:

* School portal open on his profile
* PDF of his IEP
* Email search for his name and the SENCO
* Government supports portal
* A Google Doc: *"Meetings & Agreements"*
* Start Page with:

  * *"Last meeting: agreed classroom sensory corner + shorter written tasks."*
  * *"Next Action: get follow-up on what's actually been implemented."*

When the school calls and asks to meet:

* She opens that Stax.
* Everything about *him* is there, ready. She skims her own notes, adds "Incident – [date], class, trigger (if known)."

That evening, she **shares the Stax with her partner** and, if she has one, with a trusted advocate or therapist:

* They see the same documents, same history, same notes, not a garbled recap.

The next day she walks into the school meeting not as "overwhelmed parent pulled from something else", but as "the person who has the full record".
