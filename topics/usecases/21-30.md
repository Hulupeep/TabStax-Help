 

## 21. Small Agency Founder With Three Clients Pulling at Once

You run a tiny creative agency.
Today:

* 09:00 – Brand review with **Aurora Fitness**
* 10:00 – Landing page critique for **Nova Fintech**
* 11:00 – Crisis call with **Harbour Foods** about a campaign that’s underperforming

Each client has:

* Figma files
* Email chains
* Metrics dashboards
* Shared folders
* Random Looms and notes

### Without TabStax

You Frankenstein your morning: search Gmail for “Aurora deck”, dig through Slack for Nova’s Figma link, open the wrong Harbour dashboard, and start each call slightly frazzled and half-loaded.

### With TabStax

You’ve already carved your day into three Stax:

* **“Client – Aurora Fitness (Brand)”**
* **“Client – Nova Fintech (Landing Page)”**
* **“Client – Harbour Foods (Crisis Review)”**

Each Stax includes:

* Figma / docs / dashboards for that client only
* Their main Slack/Teams channel
* Last meeting notes
* A Start Page with:

  * “Last time we…” bullets
  * **Next Actions for this call**

For Harbour, your Start Page literally says:

* *“Open with ‘I’ve looked at your numbers’*”
* *“Walk them through CTR vs industry benchmarks”*
* *“Leave with 1–2 test ideas and dates”*

You’ve **shared each Stax with the designer, copywriter, and account manager** on that client.
When you say “Open the Harbour Stax,” the whole team lands in the same cockpit: same Figma file, same metrics, same notes.

You hang up with Aurora, **close that world**, hit **Open Stax → Nova** and your brain snaps into a totally different brand, tone, and problem.

## 22. Solo Developer/Indie Hacker Pinballing Between Code, Bugs, and Launch

You’re solo, building a SaaS. Today:

* Fix a nasty auth bug
* Ship a small UI improvement
* Reply to support emails
* Prepare for a Product Hunt soft launch

Each of those is a separate mental canvas:

* Code editor docs, API ref, error logs
* UI library docs, sandbox, design reference
* Support inbox, user profiles, admin panel
* Launch checklist, landing page builder, PH draft

### Without TabStax

You open everything at once. You start debugging, then an email comes in, you open support, forget your stack trace, bounce to the landing page, tweak copy, then “oh yeah, the bug…”

### With TabStax

You create four worlds:

* **“Dev – Auth Bug #192”**
* **“Dev – UI Polish (Dashboard Cards)”**
* **“Support – Inbox Triage”**
* **“Launch – Product Hunt Prep”**

Each Stax has:

* Only the tabs needed for that task
* A Start Page with:

  * “Goal for this session”
  * 2–3 **Next Actions**

For the auth bug:

* Logs
* Error trace
* Auth provider docs
* Test account in your app
* Start Page: *“Reproduce bug → isolate conditions → add failing test.”*

You **share the Launch Stax with a friend helping with copy/PH comments** so they can see landing page, draft, and analytics at once.

You work in **tight blocks**, always switching by **closing one Stax, opening another**, not by adding new chaos to the same browser window.

## 23. Real Estate Agent on the Road Between Buyers and Sellers

You’re in the car (parked, being sensible), juggling:

* A morning of **house viewings** with a buyer
* An afternoon **valuation visit** for a seller
* A follow-up **negotiation call** in between

Different contexts:

* Buyer: shortlisted homes, maps, BER ratings, your notes on what they liked
* Seller: recent comparables, valuation spreadsheet, staging tips, photos
* Negotiation: offer history, email thread, seller notes

### Without TabStax

Your phone browser is a mess: maps, listings, WhatsApp, email, portals. You show up to the valuation trying to remember which comparables you used, fumble between tabs on a tiny screen, and hope you don’t mix up properties.

### With TabStax

You build:

* **“Buyer – The O’Reillys (Viewings Today)”**
* **“Seller – 14 Oakridge Drive (Valuation)”**
* **“Negotiation – Apt 3C / Murphy vs Landlord”**

Buyer Stax:

* Daft/MyHome tabs for each viewing
* Google Maps routes
* Notes: *“Hates road noise; loves south-facing kitchen”*
* Start Page with the viewing sequence

Seller Stax:

* Comparable sale listings
* Valuation spreadsheet
* Staging checklist
* High-res photo examples

Negotiation Stax:

* Offer spreadsheet
* Email chains
* Your notes on both parties’ bottom lines

You **share the Buyer Stax with your assistant** so they can adjust routes / timings in real time.
You **share the Seller Stax back at the office** with admin staff to prep the valuation pack.

Between appointments, you just hit **Open Stax → next client**, and your brain is now fully in “seller mode” or “negotiation mode”, not half remembering what street you’re even on.

## 24. Doctor in Clinic Moving From Routine Checkups to a Scary Lab Result

You’re in a GP clinic.

* 10:00 – Routine blood pressure check with a long-term patient
* 10:15 – Urgent review: lab just flagged abnormal results on another patient you saw last week
* 10:30 – A new patient consult you’ve never met

All three are different headspaces.

### Without TabStax

You rely on your EHR’s clunky navigation, flipping between patients, reopening guidelines, and scanning for labs. You rush into the urgent consult scanning for the right tab, a bit behind emotionally and cognitively.

### With TabStax

You set up:

* **“Clinic – Morning List”** Stax

  * EHR patient list in today’s order
  * Lab inbox
  * Clinical guidelines (hypertension, diabetes, etc.)
  * Note template
* For the flagged patient, you open a dedicated internal Stax:

  * **“Patient – Urgent Lab Review (ID: 4827)”**

That Stax contains:

* Their EHR record open at today’s lab results
* Previous visit notes
* Relevant guideline page
* A quick note you left yourself:

  * *“At last visit: discussed fatigue; no red flags then. Today: focus on X, Y, Z.”*

You **share the Clinic Stax with your nurse / admin** so they see the same list and prep/room patients in sync with your flow.

Before you enter the room for the urgent lab review:

* You close the routine checkup tabs mentally by closing that chart
* Glance at the Urgent Stax and your own note
* You walk in already oriented, not reacting on the back foot.

## 25. Teacher Running Back-to-Back Classes and Then a Parent Meeting

You teach at a secondary school.

Today:

* 09:00 – 3rd Year Maths
* 10:00 – 5th Year Applied Maths
* 11:00 – Parent-teacher meeting for a struggling student

Different prep, different resources, different emotional tone.

### Without TabStax

Your browser is some mix of past papers, YouTube videos, worksheets, Google Classroom, and the school admin portal. You scramble between classes, hunting for the right set of questions and then desperately trying to find the student’s record before the parent sits down.

### With TabStax

You create:

* **“Class – 3rd Year Maths (Simultaneous Equations)”** Stax
* **“Class – 5th Year Applied Maths (Vectors)”** Stax
* **“Meeting – Parent of Aoife K.”** Stax

Class Stax contain:

* Today’s lesson slides
* Past paper questions you’ll use
* LMS / Google Classroom for that class
* Notes: *“Yesterday they struggled with step 2; slow down there.”*

Parent Meeting Stax:

* Student record
* Recent grades
* Behaviour/attendance notes
* Notes doc with:

  * *“Start with strengths: X, Y.”*
  * *“Then discuss: missing homework, focus in class.”*
  * *“End with concrete plan: extra help / parent support.”*

You **share the Parent Stax with the year head**, so they can see what you’ll say and align.

You finish 3rd Year, close that Stax, open 5th Year.
Different level, different tone, everything ready.
Before the parent arrives, you open Aoife’s Stax and step fully into *her* story, not “generic student” mode.

## 26. Conference Organizer Switching Between Sponsors, Speakers, and Venue

You’re organizing a mid-sized conference.

You have three simultaneous tracks going on in your head:

* Sponsors: contracts, logo assets, invoicing
* Speakers: bios, talk titles, scheduling, AV needs
* Venue: rooms, layouts, catering, tech

### Without TabStax

Your browser becomes a junkyard: Stripe, DocuSign, Google Sheets, deck mockups, speaker DM threads, venue portal. You join calls half-prepared, flicking through tabs to remember what you last agreed with whom.

### With TabStax

You build three core Stax:

* **“Conf – Sponsors”**
* **“Conf – Speakers & Program”**
* **“Conf – Venue & Logistics”**

Sponsor Stax:

* Sponsor tracker sheet
* Contract templates
* Email threads
* Asset folder

Speakers Stax:

* Speaker list spreadsheet
* Bio and headshot folders
* Program draft in Docs
* Scheduling tool

Venue Stax:

* Venue portal
* Floorplans PDF
* Catering menu
* AV requirements list

You **share Sponsor Stax with your bizdev/finance helper**.
You **share Speakers Stax with your content/program co-owner**.
You **share Venue Stax with volunteers/ops coordinator**.

When you have a sponsor call, you **open Sponsor Stax** and step into that world: money, deliverables, logos.
When you hang up, you close it, open Speakers Stax, and now you’re thinking about time slots and topics, not invoice terms.

## 27. Wedding Photographer Moving From Planning to Shooting to Editing

You’re shooting a wedding this weekend, and have three distinct phases:

* Planning: shot list, schedule, family dynamics, locations
* Shooting: checklists, gear, timeline
* Editing & delivery: Lightroom, culling, gallery, album design

### Without TabStax

You plan in one mess of tabs, then the day before you’re searching Gmail for the timeline, the client’s Pinterest board, and the form with names of VIPs. After the wedding, you can’t find your own notes when editing.

### With TabStax

You create:

* **“Wedding – The Donnelly’s (Planning)”** Stax
* **“Wedding – The Donnelly’s (Shoot Day)”** Stax
* **“Wedding – The Donnelly’s (Editing & Delivery)”** Stax

Planning Stax:

* Client questionnaire
* Pinterest inspo board
* Shot list doc
* Timeline from planner

Shoot Day Stax (on your laptop or tablet):

* Timeline
* Shot list
* Family group combinations
* Weather forecast
* Map for locations

Editing Stax:

* Online gallery/Lightroom cloud
* Culling tool
* Export presets doc
* Album layout software
* Email draft for delivery

You **share Planning Stax with the planner and the couple** so everyone agrees on what’s happening.
You **share Editing Stax with your editor/retoucher** so they can see inspo, shot list, and delivery expectations.

Your brain treats each phase like a different mode. TabStax lets you switch modes with one click instead of reconstructing the wedding from memory.

## 28. YouTuber / Streamer Jumping Between Prep, Live, and Post

You run a channel.

Today:

* Prep a new video
* Go live for a stream
* Edit a past stream into clips
* Schedule social posts

Each mode uses:

* Script / outline
* Research tabs
* OBS / streaming dashboard
* Chat moderation tools
* Video editor
* Thumbnail designer
* Social scheduler

### Without TabStax

Everything piles into one monstrous browser: you’ve got Twitter open while you’re meant to be scripting, OBS while you try to edit, your brain pinging between “what’s my hook?” and “is the bitrate okay?”

### With TabStax

You define three worlds:

* **“Creator – Video Prep: ‘How I Use TabStax’”**
* **“Creator – Live Stream: Q&A”**
* **“Creator – Editing & Clips”**

Video Prep Stax:

* Script doc
* Research tabs
* Past related videos
* Idea backlog

Live Stream Stax:

* OBS Dashboard
* StreamElements/alert tool
* Twitch/YouTube Studio
* Mod tools
* Notes of topics to cover

Editing Stax:

* Video editor
* Past stream recording
* Docs with timestamps / highlight notes
* Thumbnail editor
* Social caption doc

You **share Prep and Editing Stax with your editor and thumbnail designer**.
You **share Live Stream Stax with your mods**.

Before going live, you close Prep Stax, open Live Stax, and you’re in showrunner mode.
After, you close Live, open Editing, and now you’re in “what’s the best 60 seconds?” mode.

## 29. NGO Program Manager Between Field Updates and Donor Reports

You’re running a community program for an NGO.

You have two overlapping worlds:

* Field reality: updates from local staff, WhatsApp photos, spreadsheets of attendance, issues on the ground
* Donor reality: logframes, KPIs, highly structured reports, deadlines

### Without TabStax

Your browser shows donor report templates next to grainy WhatsApp images and half-translated messages, and you mentally flip between “messy, human, local detail” and “polished, formal, structured” without any separation.

### With TabStax

You build:

* **“Program – Field Ops (Youth Centre)”** Stax
* **“Program – Donor Reporting (Youth Centre)”** Stax

Field Ops Stax:

* Shared spreadsheets from local team
* Messaging web version / shared photos folder
* Internal incident tracker
* Notes on staff meetings

Donor Reporting Stax:

* Donor portal
* Report template doc
* Indicator definitions
* Past reports

You **share Field Ops Stax with field coordinators**.
You **share Donor Stax with HQ / fundraising**.

When you’re aligning with field staff, you open Field Stax and stay in “truth on the ground” mode.
When you’re crafting the report, you open Donor Stax and stay in “translate this into logframe language” mode without the noise.

## 30. Recruiter Running a Full Interview Loop for One Candidate

You’re a recruiter.

For one critical role, you’re running:

* Screening call
* Tech interview
* Hiring manager conversation
* Reference checks

For this candidate you need:

* ATS profile
* CV / portfolio / GitHub
* Notes from screening call
* Interview feedback forms
* Email thread
* Hiring manager’s requirements
* Reference contact details

### Without TabStax

You’re hunting the candidate’s profile before each step, digging through Gmail for their GitHub, reopening the feedback form link, mixing up which manager wanted what.

### With TabStax

You create a dedicated world:

* **“Candidate – Sara K (Staff Engineer)”** Stax.

Inside:

* ATS profile open
* CV and GitHub in tabs
* Spreadsheet or doc summarizing requirements
* Links to each interview scorecard
* Email thread with candidate
* Reference contact doc
* Start Page with:

  * Timeline of stages
  * Next Actions: *“Collect tech panel feedback by EOD”, “Schedule references for Friday”*

You **share this Stax with the hiring manager and interview panel**.

Before any interview debrief, everyone opens the same Stax:

* Same profile
* Same expectations
* Same feedback forms

You’re not re-forwarding CVs, not re-explaining context. You’re all in the **“Sara K world”** together.

---

If this hits the mark, next I can do **31–40** with the same energy (more niche roles, emergency, creator, ops, etc.), or cluster these into **landing page sections** (ND, Corporate, SME, Emergency, Creator).

Tell me: **“do 31–40”** or **“help me turn these into a marketing page”**.
