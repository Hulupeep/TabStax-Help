# Neurodivergent Builder With 5 Parallel Projects

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You have:

* A Chrome extension you're building
* A book you're editing
* A small AI tool spinning up
* A landing page experiment
* A client advisory gig

Your brain wants to go deep… but the **setup cost** of getting back into each thing kills you.

## Without TabStax

You bounce between random tabs, lose the "world state" of each project, and every return feels like starting from zero. Half your energy is spent remembering what you were doing.

## With TabStax

Each project gets its own **world**:

* **"TabStax MVP – Build"**
* **"Book – Chapter 4 Editing"**
* **"AI Tool – ClaimAlert Experiments"**
* **"Landing Page Tests – May"**
* **"Client – Advisory Retainer X"**

Inside each:

* The exact tabs you need for *that* mode: editor, docs, analytics, email, notes.
* A Start Page with **3–5 concrete Next Actions** that you wrote when you last left it.

When your focus shifts:

* You close the current Stax.
* You hit **Open Stax → "Book – Chapter 4 Editing"**.
* Your manuscript, references, and last edit notes pop up.
* The Start Page says:

  * *"Fix section on TabStax use cases"*
  * *"Tighten intro paragraph"*

You're not "figuring out what to do". You're simply **continuing**.

If you collaborate (editor, dev, designer):

* You **share the relevant Stax** with them.
* They step into the same world you operate in — not a random link bundle.

**Outcome:** Each context is a saveable, reloadable "brain state". Hyperfocus becomes a weapon, not a liability.
