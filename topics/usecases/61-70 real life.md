## 1. Retiree Starting a Second Act Instead of Just Drifting

Mary has just retired after 35 years in a corporate job.

Everyone says “enjoy it!” but her brain is full of static:

* Pension and drawdown options
* Health insurance and checkups
* A list of trips she’d love to take
* Volunteer roles she bookmarked
* An online course she keeps thinking about
* A vague sense she “should do something with all this time”

### Without TabStax

It all lives in her head and scattered tabs. One day she’s reading about pensions, the next she’s looking at walking tours in Italy, the next she’s down a YouTube rabbit hole. Nothing moves forward. The years could blur.

### With TabStax

She builds **“Retirement – Foundations”** Stax:

* Pension provider portal
* Bank accounts
* Health insurance portal
* A doc: *“Monthly baseline budget & what I can safely spend.”*
* Start Page:

  * *“Confirm pension drawdown meeting date.”*
  * *“Book full health check before end of month.”*

Then she builds **“Retirement – Second Act”** Stax:

* Links to 2–3 volunteer opportunities she’s shortlisted
* Local adult education courses
* Travel ideas doc
* A brainstorm doc titled: *“What do I want the next 5 years to feel like?”*
* Start Page with ONE focus for this quarter:

  * *“This quarter’s experiment: join X volunteering group 1x/week.”*

She **shares Foundations Stax with her financial advisor and adult child** so they can see the numbers and plans.
She **shares Second Act Stax with a close friend**—they can nudge her: “Did you email the volunteer coordinator yet?”

Instead of vague “someday,” she opens one Stax and pushes one concrete next action. Retirement becomes an intentional project, not just an absence of work.

## 2. Youth Trying to Get Into College – Applications, Essays, Panic

He’s 17, final year of school, trying to get into college.

His world is:

* CAO / UCAS / Common App or local equivalent
* College websites
* Course descriptions
* Grades and predicted scores
* Personal essay/statement drafts
* Scholarship info
* Teachers’ and counsellors’ advice

### Without TabStax

He’s got 25 tabs open: three universities, a half-finished essay, a WhatsApp chat about “which course is easiest to get into”, a random Reddit thread. Every time he sits down to “work on college stuff,” he gets overwhelmed and does almost nothing.

### With TabStax

He defines two Stax:

* **“College – Research & Choices”**

  * Tabs for each realistic course/university
  * Spreadsheet comparing requirements, deadlines, and “why I care”
  * Notes from guidance counsellor

* **“College – Applications & Essays”**

  * Application portal(s)
  * Personal statement / essay drafts
  * List of deadlines
  * Doc titled: *“My story and what I bring”*
  * Start Page with short-term tasks:

    * *“Finish first full draft of personal statement by Friday.”*
    * *“Confirm teacher reference from Ms. Byrne.”*

He **shares the Research Stax with a parent or mentor** so they can see choices instead of nagging abstractly.
He **shares the Essays Stax with an English teacher or older sibling** who can leave comments in context.

Now “college stuff” isn’t amorphous. It’s:
**open the Applications Stax, do the next visible thing, close it.**
Less swirl, more progress.

## 3. Failing Student Overwhelmed and Quietly Drowning

She’s in university.
Her grades are tanking. She’s behind in three modules, ashamed, and dodging emails.

Her mental browser:

* LMS / Moodle / Canvas
* Overdue assignments
* Confusing lecture slides
* Emails from lecturers she hasn’t answered
* Student support pages she can’t quite click on

### Without TabStax

She opens the LMS, sees the mountain of red “late” labels, and closes the tab. Maybe scrolls TikTok. The story in her head is “it’s too late anyway.”

### With TabStax

She constructs **“Uni – Triage Mode (Saving This Semester)”** Stax with help from a tutor or friend:

* LMS homepage
* One tab per module she’s still trying to pass
* A single Google Doc: *“Reality Check & Plan”*

  * For each module: current grade, missing pieces, pass threshold
* Student support / tutoring / counselling links
* Start Page that says:

  * *“This is not about being perfect. This is about not disappearing.”*
  * *“Today’s Next Actions:*

    * *Email one lecturer and say ‘I’m behind, can we make a plan?’*
    * *Submit ANY version of Assignment X, even if incomplete.”*

She **shares this Stax with someone safe**—a counsellor, tutor, older friend, or sibling.

* They can see the real state, not just “I’m fine.”
* They can co-write the Reality Check doc with her.

When she opens this Stax, the chaos is structured:
modules listed, deadlines visible, one action highlighted.

It doesn’t magically fix everything. But it turns “I’m failing, so I’ll avoid it” into “Here is my failing, and here is one thing I can do today.”

## 4. The Procrastinator Who Keeps Saying “It’s Fine” While Ignoring Alarms

He’s the kind of guy whose life looks okay on the surface.

* Bills mostly paid
* Work okay
* Relationships… fine-ish

But under the hood, there are nagging alarms:

* A credit card balance that’s growing
* A small health issue he’s been ignoring
* A certification he needs to maintain for his job
* A side project he claims he “really wants” but never moves

### Without TabStax

He dismisses each worry as it pops up:

* “I’ll deal with the card when it’s bigger.”
* “If it was serious, my body would shout louder.”
* “The cert renewal email is months away.”

So he does nothing. The alarms become background noise.

### With TabStax

He builds **“Alarms – Stuff I Keep Dismissing”** Stax:

* Bank / credit card account
* Health portal or doctor’s booking site
* Certification requirements page
* Doc titled: *“If I ignore this for a year, what happens?”*
* The side project doc/tab
* Start Page brutally honest:

  * *“Credit: interest is compounding. Health: small issues rarely fix themselves. Cert: missing it could cost your job.”*
  * **Next Actions:**

    * *“Set up €X/month automatic extra card payment.”*
    * *“Book GP appointment for 4 weeks from now.”*
    * *“Block 2 hours this Sunday for certification study.”*

He **shares this Stax with a partner or accountability friend**—“these are my quiet alarms; don’t let me pretend they don’t exist.”

Once a week, he opens this Stax **on purpose**.
Not to catastrophize, but to take one small corrective action per alarm.

Procrastination becomes a pattern he can see in a single workspace, not a vibe he endlessly rationalises.

## 5. Preparing for Surgery in 4 Weeks

She’s going in for surgery in a month.

Her world explodes into:

* Pre-op instructions (fasting, meds to stop, tests to do)
* Hospital portal
* Insurance/billing details
* Work: time off, handover docs
* Home: who will mind the kids, meals, transport to/from hospital
* Recovery: physio, equipment, follow-up visits

### Without TabStax

She prints some stuff, bookmarks other bits, and leaves emails starred. She wakes up at 3am thinking “Did I ever confirm who’s picking me up?” and “When exactly do I stop taking that medication?”

### With TabStax

She creates **“Surgery – Operation & Recovery Plan”** Stax:

Tabs:

* Hospital portal and surgeon info
* Pre-op instructions PDF
* Insurance portal / coverage details
* Employer HR policy on medical leave
* Shared household Google Doc: *“While I’m in hospital & recovery”*
* List of recommended recovery equipment / physio exercises

Start Page split into **timelines**:

* **This Week:**

  * *“Book pre-op tests.”*
  * *“Tell manager and confirm leave dates.”*
* **Week Before:**

  * *“Stop medication X on [date].”*
  * *“Final check with hospital about admission time.”*
* **After Surgery:**

  * *“Schedule first physio session.”*
  * *“Review at-home care instructions with [partner/friend].”*

She **shares this Stax with her partner / key friend** and optionally a family member:

* They can see exactly what needs to happen when.
* They can add to the “While I’m in hospital” doc (meals, kid pickups, house stuff).

Now the surgery isn’t just a date. It’s a structured project with shared visibility.
When she gets scared, she opens the Stax and can tell: “I’m actually doing what needs to be done.”

## 6. Funeral Planning While Grieving

His father just died.
He’s numb, exhausted, and still the one everyone looks to for “what happens now?”

Immediate load:

* Contact funeral home
* Decide on burial/cremation
* Talk to priest/celebrant
* Coordinate obituary
* Notify relatives and friends
* Sort clothes, photos, music
* Deal with costs

### Without TabStax

He’s doing all this out of his head and phone: calls, emails, half-open tabs on funeral packages, a note somewhere with the priest’s number. Every “small” thing feels huge because he has to remember it *and* do it *and* feel it.

### With TabStax

He quietly creates **“Dad – Funeral & Farewell”** Stax:

Tabs:

* Funeral home website / email thread
* Ceremony details with priest/celebrant
* A Google Doc: *“Decisions”* (date, place, readings, speakers)
* A folder of photos for slideshow / printed boards
* Obituary draft
* A notes doc for *“Who to call / message”*

Start Page:

* A simple, gentle checklist:

  * *“Today: Confirm date & time.”*
  * *“Choose 3 photos for obituary.”*
  * *“Ask X if they want to say something.”*

He **shares this Stax with one sibling and maybe a close cousin**:

* They can help fill in names, draft the obituary, pick music.
* They can own some calls, because they can see the decisions and contacts.

He doesn’t need to hold the whole thing in his head. He opens the Stax, does the next piece, closes it when his brain can’t carry more.

The grief is still raw. TabStax just reduces the administrative cruelty layered on top.

## 7. Executor Handling Estate and Paperwork After a Death

A few weeks later, the same person (or someone else) is now executor of the estate.

Their world is:

* Will & probate docs
* Bank accounts
* Insurance policies
* Utility accounts to close or transfer
* House sale or transfer
* Letters from lawyers and tax authorities
* Siblings asking “what’s happening?”

### Without TabStax

They drown in envelopes, PDFs, and browser tabs. It all feels endless. They keep promising to “deal with the estate soon,” but never want to open that pile.

### With TabStax

They create **“Estate – [Name] (Executor Workspace)”** Stax:

Tabs:

* Probate / court guidance
* Lawyer email thread
* Spreadsheet of accounts, policies, assets
* Shared doc: *“Tasks & Status”*
* Tax authority portal (if relevant)

Start Page with grouped Next Actions:

* **Bank & Money:** close account A, get statement from B
* **House:** get valuation, contact estate agent
* **Siblings:** write one update email summarizing where things stand

They **share a read-only version of this Stax with siblings**:

* They can see the same checklist and know progress.
* Fewer “so what’s going on?” phone calls.

They open the Stax once or twice a week as “estate time,” handle one cluster, then close it.
Instead of “I should be doing everything,” they’re doing *something* in a defined container.

## 8. Midlife “Quiet Crisis” – Life’s Okay, But They Know It’s Not Fine

She’s 42. Life is… fine.

* Stable job she doesn’t love
* Relationship that’s more logistics than connection
* Health “basically okay”
* A creative dream she’s been saying “I’ll do later” for 15 years

These are **quiet alarms**, not emergencies. Which makes them easier to ignore.

### Without TabStax

She feels a low-level dissatisfaction and occasionally binge-reads self-help or checks job boards. Then she goes back to autopilot.

### With TabStax

She creates **“Life – Nagging Thoughts I Don’t Want to Lose”** Stax:

Tabs:

* Journal doc: *“What’s bothering me that I keep minimising?”*
* Job market / roles she’s curious about
* A doc: *“If nothing changes in 5 years, what does life look like?”*
* An outline for a creative project (book, podcast, business)
* Therapy/coaching resources page

Start Page with 3 gentle but pointed questions:

* *“What is one experiment I could run in the next 90 days?”*
* *“What am I afraid will happen if I never try?”*
* *“Who is one person I could talk to about this?”*

She **shares this Stax only with one trusted person**—a partner, best friend, coach, or therapist.

* They can see the shape of her unease.
* They can reflect it back without it being hand-wavy.

Once a week, she opens this Stax **on purpose**.
Not to fix her entire life, but to move one experiment forward: book a therapy consult, sign up for a class, send an email, set a coffee with someone in a job she admires.

Instead of letting the “everything’s fine” mask smother the alarms, she gives those alarms a contained, named place to live and evolve.
