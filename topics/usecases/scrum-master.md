# Scrum Master With a Standup That Can Run Without Them

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You run daily standup for **Team Falcon**.

Your "standup cockpit" usually includes:

* Jira board in the exact column view you use
* Sprint Goal page
* Bug list filtered to "today's issues"
* CI/CD status page
* A short script / checklist for running standup

## Without TabStax

When you're sick or late, the team freestyles. Standup loses structure, and new members are confused.

## With TabStax

You create **"Team Falcon – Standup Stax"**:

* All the above tabs saved
* Start Page with:

  * *"Step 1: Revisit Sprint Goal"*
  * *"Step 2: Yesterday / Today / Blockers"*
  * *"Step 3: Check critical bugs"*

You **share the Stax with the whole team**.

On any given morning:

* You open Stax → everything you need is arranged exactly how you like it.
* If you're out, someone else clicks the same Stax link.
* The board, the checklist, and priorities are identical.

**Outcome:** Your process becomes a reusable kit. Standup is a system, not a personality.
