## 1. Mum With a Son Who Has Special Needs – The Call From the School

She’s at the kitchen table, finally trying to get some work done, when her phone rings.

It’s the school.
Her son melted down in class. There was an incident. They want a meeting tomorrow.

Her world for this child already spans:

* School portal
* IEP / support plan
* Email from the SENCO, occupational therapist, psychologist
* Government benefits portal
* Autism/ADHD resources she trusts
* Her own notes from past meetings

### Without TabStax

Every incident is a fresh storm. She scrambles: searching her inbox, opening the wrong report, hunting for the last IEP, trying to remember what they promised last time. By the time she’s in the meeting, she’s reactive and exhausted.

### With TabStax

She already has **“[Child’s Name] – School & Supports”** Stax:

* School portal open on his profile
* PDF of his IEP
* Email search for his name and the SENCO
* Government supports portal
* A Google Doc: *“Meetings & Agreements”*
* Start Page with:

  * *“Last meeting: agreed classroom sensory corner + shorter written tasks.”*
  * *“Next Action: get follow-up on what’s actually been implemented.”*

When the school calls and asks to meet:

* She opens that Stax.
* Everything about *him* is there, ready. She skims her own notes, adds “Incident – [date], class, trigger (if known).”

That evening, she **shares the Stax with her partner** and, if she has one, with a trusted advocate or therapist:

* They see the same documents, same history, same notes, not a garbled recap.

The next day she walks into the school meeting not as “overwhelmed parent pulled from something else”, but as “the person who has the full record”.

## 2. Bill, 240lbs, Training for His First Marathon

Bill is 240lbs and has decided: *I’m running a marathon this year.*
Not to “get skinny”. To prove to himself he can.

His world now has:

* Beginner marathon training plans
* YouTube videos on form
* Articles on running at higher weight
* Shoe and gear reviews
* A calendar mapping out long runs
* Nutrition and recovery guides

### Without TabStax

He keeps googling the same stuff. Training plans in one tab, shoe reviews in another, a random blog post open on his phone. He forgets which plan he chose. Every time he thinks “I should train” he has to rebuild the universe.

### With TabStax

He builds **“Bill – Marathon 2025”** Stax:

* The **one training plan** he chose
* A shoe store tab with his shortlist
* A spreadsheet logging runs
* A YouTube playlist: “Running Form & Recovery”
* A calendar showing the 16–20 week build
* Start Page with:

  * *“This week’s long run: 5 miles on Saturday.”*
  * *“Next Action TODAY: 20-minute easy run + 5 minutes form drills.”*

He **shares this Stax with his running buddy / partner / accountability friend**:

* They see his plan.
* They can drop comments (“I added a link about knee-friendly strength work.”).

Every time doubt creeps in, the task is simple: **open the Marathon Stax**.

* The plan
* The progress
* The “why”

…all load at once. He’s not restarting the project every time he laces up — he’s continuing a story.

## 3. Anne, Laid Off, on a Weekly Accountability Call With Three Also-Fired Friends

Anne just got laid off. So did three of her friends from the same company.

They start a **weekly accountability call**.
Each has their own goals:

* Anne: build a pipeline of interviews
* Friend 1: launch a freelance consulting offer
* Friend 2: explore a career pivot
* Friend 3: finally ship a personal project

### Without TabStax

The calls devolve into updates like “yeah, I did some stuff”. Their browsers are chaos: job boards, half-written resumes, random notes, bookmarked posts. The group energy is good, but the execution is fuzzy.

### With TabStax

They create a **shared Stax for the group**:
**“Laid Off, Leveling Up – Accountability Crew”**.

Inside:

* A shared doc with each person’s **quarter goal**
* A sheet with weekly checkpoints
* Links to: job boards, networking communities, key resources
* A recurring meeting link

Then **each person** creates their own personal Stax:

* **“Anne – Job Search & Interviews”**

  * CV and tailored versions
  * LinkedIn profile and saved searches
  * Applications tracker
  * Draft outreach messages
  * Start Page Next Actions:

    * *“Apply to 2 roles today.”*
    * *“DM 1 person I know at companies I care about.”*

On call day:

* They all open the **shared group Stax**.
* Then each opens their own Stax when it’s their turn.

Between calls, they can **peek at each other’s Stax** (if they choose to share them) and see real work, not just self-reported stories.

The accountability becomes grounded: not “I’ll do something by EOW,” but “I will move the next action in my Stax.”

## 4. Anne Building an App, One Customer at a Time

Different Anne.
She’s building an app, and she’s decided: she doesn’t care about “scale” yet. She cares about **“one real paying customer at a time”**.

Her reality:

* A basic landing page
* A Supabase or Firebase backend
* A Notion doc of customer interviews
* Stripe or payment link
* A list of 20 people she thinks she can help
* DM threads and email replies

### Without TabStax

It’s all one soup: code editor, landing page builder, Stripe dashboard, Gmail, DMs. When she tries to focus on “just one customer,” she still has 11 other tabs whispering in her face.

### With TabStax

She creates a separate Stax for each prospective customer she’s truly dancing with:

* **“Customer 001 – Jamie (Freelance Designer)”**
* **“Customer 002 – Priya (Ops Manager)”**
* and so on…

Each Customer Stax contains:

* Their email / DM thread
* Notes from conversation
* A one-page doc: “What I think their world looks like”
* The specific prototype / view she’s assembling for them
* Start Page with 1–2 **Next Actions**:

  * *“Ship small tweak they asked for by Thursday”*
  * *“Ask: would you pay €X/month if it did ABC?”*

She also keeps a **“Build – Core Product”** Stax for her own engineering work.

She **shares specific Customer Stax with a mentor or friend** who’s helping her validate. That person can see everything about that customer — the thread, the prototype, the notes — and give feedback like “you’re overbuilding” or “this pain looks real”.

Her metric becomes:
“How many Customer Stax have moved from ‘exploring’ to ‘paid’?”

## 5. Caregiver for an Ageing Parent, Managing Medical, Legal, and Daily Life

He’s the “responsible child” for his ageing mum.

His world:

* GP and specialist portals
* Medication lists
* Lab results
* Legal docs (power of attorney, will)
* Home care providers
* Benefits and pension info
* Siblings’ WhatsApp thread with opinions

### Without TabStax

Every new issue — a fall, a new prescription, a letter about benefits — sends him back into the mess. He hunts for which login goes where, which doctor said what, and how that aligns with the legal stuff. Siblings ask questions he can’t quickly answer without repeating a 20-minute search.

### With TabStax

He defines **“Mum – Health & Life Admin”** Stax:

* GP portal tab
* Specialist clinic portal
* Medications tracking sheet
* Folder with scans of legal docs
* Benefits/pension portal
* A running “Timeline & Notes” doc
* Start Page:

  * *“Last updates: new blood pressure meds, physio referral.”*
  * *“Next Actions: schedule follow-up, check side effects, call benefits office about letter.”*

He **shares this Stax with his siblings** (with passwords handled via manager, not in-stax, obviously).

Now when the benefits letter arrives or the doctor calls:

* He opens that Stax.
* Takes notes *in one place*.
* Siblings can open the Stax and self-serve: “Oh, she already had that scan; here’s the date.”

The caregiving load is still heavy. But the cognitive retrieval tax is much lighter.

## 6. Recently Sober Person Balancing Recovery, Work, and Rebuilding Life

They’re newly sober.
Life is now three overlapping, fragile layers:

* Recovery: online meetings, sponsor contact, readings, journaling
* Work: still have a job, still have responsibilities
* Rebuilding: money, relationships, health

### Without TabStax

The recovery tabs (meeting list, readings, chat boards) sit in the same window as work email and YouTube. One bad day, they go searching for help but fall into distraction instead.

### With TabStax

They create:

* **“Recovery – Daily Kit”** Stax:

  * Online meeting directory
  * Daily reading
  * Journal
  * Number / contact page for sponsor (or equivalent)
  * Start Page:

    * *“If craving: 1) text X, 2) open meeting link, 3) write 5 sentences.”*

* **“Work – Today”** Stax:

  * Email
  * Task list
  * Project docs

* **“Rebuild – Money & Life”** Stax:

  * Bank accounts
  * Budget tracker
  * Small goals list

They **share Recovery Stax (or a subset) with their sponsor / trusted friend**:

* “If I text you, this is the world I’m using. You can see the readings and plan I’m working from.”

When things get wobbly, the action is: **open Recovery Stax**.
No search. No choice architecture. Just the next right tools.

## 7. Community Organizer Leading a Tenant Group

She’s helping tenants in a building organize around rent hikes and repairs.

Her world:

* Group WhatsApp/Signal
* Local tenant rights resources
* City housing department portal
* A spreadsheet of tenants, flats, and status
* Petition or complaint form
* Meeting notes from past discussions

### Without TabStax

Every WhatsApp ping sends her back into ad hoc mode. When the city asks for specifics, she wastes time re-building the list or searching for the last reference link. Tenants ask “what’s the latest?” and she has to reconstruct the state of play manually.

### With TabStax

She defines **“Tenants – Building 42 Oak Street”** Stax:

* Shared spreadsheet of tenants, unit numbers, contact, issues
* Local tenants’ union site
* City complaint/inspection portal
* Shared doc of demands and timeline
* Meeting notes doc
* Start Page:

  * *“Current phase: collect 30 signatures.”*
  * *“Next Actions: reach out to flats 2B, 3C, 5A.”*

She **shares this Stax with the tenant committee**:

* Anyone who joins can onboard themselves: read history, check demands, see who’s already involved.

When someone new says “how can I help?”, instead of a 40-minute info dump she can say:

* “Open the Tenants Stax. Start with the doc ‘Read first’, then text me.”

## 8. Person Planning a Big Move to Another Country

They’re moving from Dublin to Berlin.

Tabs everywhere:

* Visa / registration requirements
* Housing websites
* Job prospects
* Cost-of-living comparisons
* Language resources
* Airline and moving quotes
* Spreadsheet of “things to cancel, things to set up”

### Without TabStax

Their move exists as 50 tabs across devices plus notes in three apps. They forget which “how to register in Germany” guide they trusted. Every time they sit down to plan, they feel like they’re starting again.

### With TabStax

They create **“Move – Dublin → Berlin 2026”** Stax:

* Official city registration site
* Trusted “moving to Germany” guide
* Flat rental portals
* Job board / LinkedIn
* Budget & cost-of-living sheet
* Checklist doc:

  * *“Ireland: cancel X, close Y, change Z.”*
  * *“Germany: register, bank, insurance, SIM, etc.”*

They **share the Stax with their partner / family / friend helping them**.

Now conversations are:

* “Can you look at the Move Stax and see what’s left under ‘Before leaving Ireland’?”
* “I added a new flat to the Stax tab, take a look.”

When anxiety spikes (“this is too much”), they don’t have to remember everything. They just open their Move world and do **one Next Action**.

## 9. Artist Turning a Hobby Into a Small Online Shop

She’s been painting for years. She’s finally decided to sell prints and originals.

Current needs:

* Decide on a platform (Etsy, Shopify, Squarespace)
* Photograph/scan artwork
* Set prices
* Set up payment and shipping
* Promote on Instagram / TikTok
* Track orders and commissions

### Without TabStax

She flutters between tutorials, shop platforms, pricing advice articles, and Instagram, never anchoring the project structure. Every time she thinks “I should work on the shop,” she has to remember what the next step even is.

### With TabStax

She creates **“Art Shop – Launch”** Stax:

* Chosen platform admin (say, Etsy draft shop)
* A doc listing each piece, size, medium, suggested price
* Resources on shipping/packaging
* Payment account setup page
* Canva or photo editor for images
* Start Page with a 3-step launch path:

  * *“1. Finalize 10 pieces and prices”*
  * *“2. Upload photos + descriptions”*
  * *“3. Post first launch teaser on IG.”*

She **shares this Stax with a trusted friend / partner** who’s cheering her on:

* They can see, concretely, how close she is.
* They can add notes or links (“use this packaging supplier”).

Every launch session starts by opening that one Stax; the “I’m just an artist, I’m bad at admin” voice has less power when the admin world is already arranged.

## 10. Young Adult Balancing Uni, Side Hustle, and Family Expectations

They’re doing a degree, trying to spin up a little freelance income on the side, and also dealing with family pressure about grades and “real jobs”.

Their worlds:

* Uni: learning platform, lecture slides, assignment portals
* Side hustle: portfolio, Upwork/Fiverr listings, invoicing, client chats
* Family: budget, long-term planning tabs, maybe visa or loan info

### Without TabStax

Everything collides. They sit down to work on an assignment and end up scrolling Upwork. They try to do client work with a lecture PDF half-open and WhatsApp from home asking about exam results.

### With TabStax

They split reality into:

* **“Uni – Current Modules (This Week)”** Stax
* **“Side Hustle – Clients & Pipeline”** Stax
* **“Life – Money, Family, Future”** Stax

Uni Stax:

* LMS
* Current assignment brief
* Revision notes
* Past paper bank

Side Hustle Stax:

* Portfolio site editor
* Freelance platform dashboard
* Client comms tabs
* Invoicing system

Life Stax:

* Budget tracker
* Long-term plan doc
* Tabs for visas/loans or next steps

They **share the Side Hustle Stax with a friend or mentor**, and maybe **share a “Safe View” of Uni Stax** with a study buddy.

When they say, “I’m doing uni work now,” they open Uni Stax and close the others.
When they say, “I’m doing client work now,” they open Side Hustle Stax and stand in that frame.

The work doesn’t get easier — but **switching between selves** gets intentionally controlled instead of chaotic.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Cluster all these “human, non-traditional” ones into a **“TabStax for Real Life”** section for your site.
* Or do another 10 in the same style for other edges: neurodivergent teens, carers, activists, gamers, hobby communities.
