## 31. Public Defender in LA, 100 Degrees, Court in 10 Minutes

It’s Los Angeles, 3:20pm, 100 degrees.
He’s in his car outside the courthouse, laptop balanced on the steering wheel, AC fighting for its life.

In 10 minutes, he’s standing in front of a judge on **People v. Ramirez**. Before that, he was working on two other cases in completely different states of chaos:

* A plea negotiation on **People v. Johnson**
* A bail review on **People v. Flores**

Each case lives in its own mess:

* Court docket
* Discovery PDFs
* Notes from last client meeting
* Email from DA
* Motion draft
* Sentencing guideline references

### Without TabStax

His browser is 40 tabs deep. Ramirez motion draft is somewhere. The DA’s last email is buried. The docket link? Who knows. Sweat, literal and metaphorical. He goes into court with “good enough” recall and hopes he doesn’t miss something crucial.

### With TabStax

He’s already set up:

* **“Case – People v. Ramirez”** Stax
* **“Case – People v. Johnson (Plea)”**
* **“Case – People v. Flores (Bail Review)”**

Ramirez Stax includes:

* The case in the LA court portal
* The motion draft
* Email thread with the DA
* Notes from his last jail visit
* A tab with relevant statute / guidelines
* Start Page with bold Next Actions:

  * *“Argue for continuance if DA’s offer unchanged”*
  * *“Bring up missing discovery from 03/14”*

He **shares the Ramirez Stax with his investigator and paralegal** earlier in the week:

* Investigator adds a tab with a key witness statement.
* Paralegal adds a timeline doc and a checklist.

Sitting in the baking car now, he hits **Open Stax → Ramirez**.

* The docket is right there
* The motion is open to the last paragraph he edited
* His notes remind him: *“Client wants to avoid any plea with strike implications; confirm understanding of risk on record.”*

He closes Johnson and Flores worlds. For these 10 minutes, his whole brain is Ramirez.
When his case is called, he walks in hot, but not scattered — his environment did the remembering for him.

## 32. Manufacturing Ops Manager Between Factory Floor, Supplier Crisis, and Audit

She runs operations for a small manufacturing plant.

Today:

* A machine on **Line 3** is intermittently failing
* A critical **supplier shipment is delayed**
* An external **quality audit** is happening this afternoon

Each one involves different tools:

* Factory floor dashboard, maintenance logs, SOPs
* Supplier portal, email threads, cost spreadsheets
* Audit checklist, documentation, non-conformance reports

### Without TabStax

She drags everything into one chaotic browser: live machine metrics, half-open PDFs, emails from the supplier, and an audit checklist she keeps misplacing. When the auditor asks for a specific record, she hunts frantically.

### With TabStax

She builds three Stax:

* **“Ops – Line 3 Intermittent Fault”**
* **“Ops – Supplier Delay: SteelCo”**
* **“Ops – Quality Audit (Today)”**

Line 3 Stax:

* Live machine dashboard
* Maintenance ticket history
* SOP doc
* Notes: *“Intermittent since last firmware update; cross-check with vendor.”*

Supplier Delay Stax:

* Purchase order in ERP
* Supplier portal
* Email thread
* Contingency planning sheet

Audit Stax:

* Audit checklist
* Document index
* File share with certificates and procedures
* Non-conformance log

She **shares the Line 3 Stax with the maintenance supervisor** so they see the same logs and SOP.
She **shares the Audit Stax with QA lead** so they can pre-open docs and tag gaps.

In the morning, she focuses on Line 3: **Open Line 3 Stax**, walk the floor, update notes.
Then she closes it and **opens Supplier Delay** for a call with SteelCo.
Just before the audit starts, she opens Audit Stax — everything they’ll ask for is one click away.

She moves through the day as if each crisis has its own cockpit — because it does.

## 33. Film Editor Cutting a Feature and a Trailer for a Different Client

He’s in an edit suite, working on:

* A **feature film rough cut** for Director A
* A **punchy 90-second trailer** for Brand B’s campaign

The tools overlap but the worlds don’t:

* Feature film: long timeline, character arcs, director’s notes, continuity sheets
* Brand trailer: brand guidelines, endcard requirements, legal lines, media specs

### Without TabStax

His browser and reference windows are a tangle: script PDFs, frame.io comments, two different brand folders, music licensing pages. When Director A drops in on Zoom, he still has Brand B’s style guide open and spends the first five minutes finding the last cut.

### With TabStax

He defines:

* **“Edit – Feature: ‘Glass Harbor’ Rough Cut”**
* **“Edit – Trailer: Brand B Spring Campaign”**

Feature Stax:

* Script
* Scene breakdown
* Frame.io comments from the director
* Shared continuity notes
* Music temp tracks folder

Trailer Stax:

* Brand guidelines
* Asset folder (logos, fonts)
* Client feedback doc
* Legal disclaimers
* Target placement specs (length, formats)

He **shares Glass Harbor Stax with the director and producer**. They add reference clips and notes.
He **shares Brand B Stax with the agency producer**, who drops in the latest brief and media specs.

He blocks his day:

* Morning: **Open Glass Harbor Stax** – he’s living in scenes, emotion, pacing.
* Afternoon: **Open Brand B Stax** – now he’s living in punchy hooks, brand beats, and timing for ads.

Each world feels intact, self-contained. When a Zoom invite hits from Director A, he opens that Stax and everything — including the last comment thread — is already live.

## 34. Hospital Social Worker Handling Three Complex Discharges

She’s the social worker covering a busy hospital ward.

Today she’s juggling three complicated discharges:

* An elderly patient going home alone with mobility issues
* A young parent needing community mental health support
* A homeless patient who needs coordinated discharge to temporary accommodation

Each case requires:

* Electronic health record
* Community services directory
* Housing or benefits portals
* Notes from multidisciplinary team meetings
* Contact logs

### Without TabStax

Her browser is a maze of portals, PDFs, and notes. She keeps 6–10 tabs pinned and prays she doesn’t close one accidentally. Each time she switches patients, she wastes time re-opening the right combination of records and websites.

### With TabStax

She sets up:

* **“Case – Mrs. O’Shea (Mobility + Home Support)”**
* **“Case – Daniel M. (Mental Health + Parenting Support)”**
* **“Case – ‘John Doe’ (Homeless Discharge)”**

Each Stax contains:

* EHR open to that patient
* Relevant portals (home care services, benefits, housing, mental health services)
* Notes doc summarizing family situation and MDT decisions
* A start tab with:

  * Key risks
  * Key agencies involved
  * **Next Actions**

For John Doe, the Start Page might say:

* *“Call outreach worker at X charity”*
* *“Submit form Y for temporary accommodation”*
* *“Update discharge planner by 15:00”*

She **shares each Stax with the ward discharge coordinator and, where appropriate, another social worker**.

As she moves between cases:

* She closes one Stax and opens the next, fully re-entering that patient’s story and support network in seconds.

She doesn’t carry all three in short term memory; TabStax holds the complexity so she can be fully present in the conversation at hand.

## 35. Festival Ops Lead Juggling Security, Weather, and Artist Schedules

It’s day two of a three-day music festival.

The ops lead is balancing:

* A **minor security incident** at one gate
* A **changing weather front** threatening the main stage later
* An **artist whose flight is delayed**

Tools:

* Security incident log
* Radio/communications hub
* Weather radar
* Stage schedule
* Airline/travel tracking
* Artist liaison chat

### Without TabStax

They click through browser tabs on a laptop in a noisy operations cabin, trying to remember which window held the gate camera and where they bookmarked the backup weather model. Every new issue adds more noise.

### With TabStax

They’ve created:

* **“Festival – Live Ops Cockpit”** Stax
* **“Festival – Weather Risk: Stage A”** Stax
* **“Festival – Artist Logistics: Day 2”** Stax

Live Ops Cockpit:

* Security live view
* Incident ticket log
* Radio/dispatch dashboard
* Site map

Weather Risk Stax:

* Detailed weather radar
* Forecast model pages
* Risk matrix doc
* Contingency plan with “move show to Stage B” protocol

Artist Logistics Stax:

* Airline tracking page
* Spreadsheet of artist travel details
* Messages with agents
* Updated stage schedule

They **share Live Ops Cockpit Stax with security supervisors and medical**.
They **share Weather Risk Stax with stage managers and production**.
They **share Artist Logistics Stax with artist liaison team & booking manager**.

As each problem heats up or cools down, they **switch Stax**: when they’re in Weather, they’re 100% thinking “wind, rain, schedule,” not “where did we log that lost phone?”

The whole team starts talking in shorthand:
“Check the Weather Stax; check the Artist Stax.”

## 36. HR Generalist Dealing With a Grievance, an Offer, and a Policy Rollout

She’s HR in a 200-person company.

Within three hours, she needs to:

* Prepare for a **grievance meeting** with an upset employee
* Get an **offer letter out** to a senior hire
* Finalize a **new hybrid work policy** to roll out next week

Each uses different data sensitivities and emotional tones.

### Without TabStax

She has Gmail, HRIS, Google Docs, Slack, and a contract template all open at once. She jumps from grievance notes to offer letter paragraphs to policy bullets without resetting. Easy to mis-send the wrong doc or carry the emotional weight of the grievance into the cheerfulness of the offer call.

### With TabStax

She defines:

* **“HR – Grievance: Case #2025-04”**
* **“HR – Offer: Senior PM Candidate”**
* **“HR – Policy: Hybrid Work Rollout”**

Grievance Stax:

* Case log
* Relevant policy documents
* Emails
* Notes from previous meetings
* Meeting plan:

  * *“Listen first, clarify, summarise back.”*

Offer Stax:

* Offer letter template
* Comp bands doc
* Candidate profile
* Email draft

Policy Stax:

* Draft policy doc
* Legal review notes
* FAQ for employees
* Rollout plan

She **shares Grievance Stax (internal version) with HR director and legal**.
She **shares Policy Stax with leadership team** for final comments.
She **shares a curated version of Offer Stax with the hiring manager** to align on details.

When she moves from grievance prep to offer call, she closes the Grievance Stax — mentally closing that loop — and opens the Offer Stax. Her environment shifts to “welcoming, excited, clear” instead of “tense, investigative”.

## 37. Investment Analyst Covering Three Sectors on Earnings Week

He’s an equity analyst.

This week, three of “his” companies across **three sectors** are reporting earnings:

* Tech: CloudCo
* Consumer: FreshFoods
* Industrials: RailTrans

Each earnings story uses different KPIs, comps, and narratives.

### Without TabStax

His Bloomberg/terminal windows and browser tabs are a tangle of PDFs, models, call transcripts, and competitor charts. He keeps reopening the wrong model or clicking into the wrong transcript.

### With TabStax

He sets up:

* **“Coverage – CloudCo Earnings Q2”**
* **“Coverage – FreshFoods Earnings Q2”**
* **“Coverage – RailTrans Earnings Q2”**

Each Stax holds for that company:

* Model (spreadsheet)
* Last quarter’s deck
* Today’s deck PDF
* Live transcript / call webcast
* Notes doc with key questions
* Comps table

He **shares each Stax with his PM and associate**.

When it’s CloudCo’s call:

* He opens CloudCo Stax; his notes and model are exactly where he left them.
* After the call, he updates assumptions and writes a quick note in the same world.

Later, he closes CloudCo and opens FreshFoods:

* New model, new comps, new thesis.
* His start page says: *“Focus on margin recovery & store count, not just top-line.”*

He doesn’t carry three theses in his working RAM; TabStax loads one coverage “universe” at a time.

## 38. City Planner Balancing a New Transport Corridor, a Housing Project, and Public Input

She’s working in a city planning office.

Right now she’s deep in:

* A **new bus rapid transit corridor** proposal
* A controversial **housing development** under review
* A scheduled **public consultation evening** where both will get shouted about

Each topic needs:

* GIS maps
* Traffic models
* Policy documents
* Developer submissions
* Public feedback portal
* Internal memos

### Without TabStax

Her browser is piled with shapefiles, PDFs, forms, and council minutes. She hops from transport to housing to consultation logistics without ever feeling fully anchored in any.

### With TabStax

She creates:

* **“Planning – Transit Corridor North-South”**
* **“Planning – Housing Development: Elm Street”**
* **“Planning – Public Consultation: June 18”**

Transit Stax:

* Route maps
* Environmental assessments
* Technical studies
* Funding options

Housing Stax:

* Site plans
* Developer proposal
* Objections and submissions
* Zoning regulations

Consultation Stax:

* Event agenda
* Slide deck for public
* FAQ doc
* Online feedback form builder

She **shares Transit Stax with transport engineers**.
She **shares Housing Stax with legal and councillors**.
She **shares Consultation Stax with comms and event staff**.

On the day of the consultation, she closes Transit/Housing Stax and opens Consultation Stax only. Her machine, her notes, her slides are all in *“listen & explain”* mode, not in “tweak the model” mode.

## 39. Policy Lobbyist Prepping Lawmakers for a Committee Hearing

He works for an advocacy org.

Tomorrow, there’s a **parliamentary committee hearing** on a topic his organisation cares deeply about. He needs to:

* Prep three supportive lawmakers with **tailored briefing packs**
* Track opposition talking points
* Coordinate media follow-up

### Without TabStax

His browser is full of bill texts, amendments, op-eds, polling, MP profiles. He copies/pastes into docs and emails, hoping not to send the wrong briefing to the wrong office.

### With TabStax

He builds:

* **“Hearing – Core Evidence & Arguments”** Stax
* **“Briefing – MP A (Education angle)”**
* **“Briefing – MP B (Economic angle)”**
* **“Briefing – MP C (Constituency impact)”**

Core Evidence Stax:

* Bill text
* Amendment documents
* Research papers
* Polls

Each MP Stax:

* MP’s profile and speeches
* Constituency data
* Tailored 1-page brief
* Suggested questions for the hearing

He **shares the Core Evidence Stax internally** with his team.
He **shares each MP Stax (curated) with that MP’s staffer**:

* They open their Stax and see everything: suggested lines, supporting stats, local angle.

On hearing day, he also has a **Media Follow-up Stax**:

* Press list
* Draft press releases
* Social copy

He swaps between them as the day unfolds, each world representing a different audience and frame of the same issue.

## 40. Remote-First Founder Doing Investor Pitch, Hiring Interview, and Roadmap Review

You’re a remote-first founder.

In one afternoon you must:

* Give a **second-call investor pitch**
* Conduct a **final interview for a senior engineer**
* Lead an **internal roadmap review** with your team

Each “room” you enter expects a different story from the same product.

### Without TabStax

You keep pitch deck, hiring scorecards, roadmap doc, and Miro board all floating in one environment. You show the investor the wrong roadmap version, open the candidate’s CV during the team review, fumble for the right doc when the investor asks about metrics.

### With TabStax

You set up:

* **“Founder – Investor Pitch: Seed Round (Call 2)”**
* **“Founder – Hiring: Senior Engineer Final”**
* **“Founder – Roadmap Review Q3”**

Investor Stax:

* Investor-specific deck
* Metrics dashboard
* Notes on partner’s interests
* Email chain
* Start Page:

  * *“Hit why now + traction early, leave tech deep dive for when they ask.”*

Hiring Stax:

* Candidate’s CV / GitHub
* Job scorecard
* Structured interview questions
* Feedback form

Roadmap Stax:

* Current roadmap doc
* Miro/whiteboard
* Notes from last retro
* Feature ideas backlog

You **share Investor Stax with your co-founder/CFO**.
You **share Hiring Stax with the panel**.
You **share Roadmap Stax with the whole product team**.

As the clock shifts:

* Before investor call: open Investor Stax, brain in “story + numbers” mode.
* After: close it, open Hiring Stax, now in “assess alignment + skill” mode.
* Later: open Roadmap Stax, now “trade-offs + priorities” mode.

You come across as grounded and present in each context because you’re not hauling all three in memory at once.
