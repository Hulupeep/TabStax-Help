# Remote-First Founder Doing Investor Pitch, Hiring Interview, and Roadmap Review

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You're a remote-first founder.

In one afternoon you must:

* Give a **second-call investor pitch**
* Conduct a **final interview for a senior engineer**
* Lead an **internal roadmap review** with your team

Each "room" you enter expects a different story from the same product.

## Without TabStax

You keep pitch deck, hiring scorecards, roadmap doc, and Miro board all floating in one environment. You show the investor the wrong roadmap version, open the candidate's CV during the team review, fumble for the right doc when the investor asks about metrics.

## With TabStax

You set up:

* **"Founder – Investor Pitch: Seed Round (Call 2)"**
* **"Founder – Hiring: Senior Engineer Final"**
* **"Founder – Roadmap Review Q3"**

Investor Stax:

* Investor-specific deck
* Metrics dashboard
* Notes on partner's interests
* Email chain
* Start Page:

  * *"Hit why now + traction early, leave tech deep dive for when they ask."*

Hiring Stax:

* Candidate's CV / GitHub
* Job scorecard
* Structured interview questions
* Feedback form

Roadmap Stax:

* Current roadmap doc
* Miro/whiteboard
* Notes from last retro
* Feature ideas backlog

You **share Investor Stax with your co-founder/CFO**.
You **share Hiring Stax with the panel**.
You **share Roadmap Stax with the whole product team**.

As the clock shifts:

* Before investor call: open Investor Stax, brain in "story + numbers" mode.
* After: close it, open Hiring Stax, now in "assess alignment + skill" mode.
* Later: open Roadmap Stax, now "trade-offs + priorities" mode.

You come across as grounded and present in each context because you're not hauling all three in memory at once.
