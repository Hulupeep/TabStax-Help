 
## 1. Professor Running for State Senator Under Fire

He’s a tenured professor.
He’s also now a **candidate for state senate**.

He cares about policy, ideas, students.
But the campaign is a different beast:

* Opposition oppo teams digging into 20 years of career
* Local radio and TV interviews
* A campaign team that’s half volunteers
* Family under new scrutiny
* His own health and mental bandwidth at risk

The opposition thinks he’s roadkill: too soft, too academic, not built for the mud.

### Without TabStax

His laptop is a disaster: academic papers, campaign strategy docs, health portal, school emails, and security briefings all in the same tab bar. One minute he’s reading poll crosstabs, the next he’s grading, then panicking about a hit piece someone just sent him. His partner asks “what’s the plan if they go after us?” and he says “we’ll figure it out” — but there’s no actual place where that plan lives.

### With TabStax

He deliberately splits his life into **four Stax**:

1. **“Campaign – Strategy & Field”**

   * Polling and district data
   * Voter file tools
   * Field plan / canvass scripts
   * Issue briefs
   * Slack/Discord for the campaign team
   * Start Page:

     * *“This week: lock down education & healthcare message, support field on weekend canvass.”*

2. **“Campaign – Media & Messaging”**

   * Press list
   * Talking points by issue
   * Media training resources
   * Calendar with interviews / debates
   * A doc titled: *“Stories I actually want to tell”*
   * Next Actions:

     * *“Review Q&A for tonight’s local radio.”*
     * *“Practice 3 clean soundbites out loud.”*

3. **“Personal – Health & Mental Bandwidth”**

   * Health portal
   * Sleep / exercise tracker
   * Therapist / coach session scheduler
   * ‘Non-negotiables’ doc:

     * *“At least X sleep; no calls after Y; walk every day.”*

4. **“Family – Safety, Boundaries, & Support”**

   * Notes from conversation with security advisor
   * School / kids’ portals
   * A doc where he and his partner list:

     * *“What do we keep private?”*
     * *“What we will never engage with online.”*

He **shares these Stax carefully**:

* Strategy & Media Stax with campaign manager + senior volunteers
* Health Stax (part of it) with his doctor/therapist (“this is what my life looks like now”)
* Family Stax with his partner only

Before an interview, he **opens Media & Messaging Stax** and the world narrows: no grading, no Twitter, just the prep doc, the talking points, the last recording of him practicing.

After a brutal day, he **closes the campaign worlds**, opens the Health Stax, and books the next therapy session *while he’s still clear he needs it*.

He might still get hit hard. But he isn’t living inside one giant undifferentiated chaos tab. Each role has its own cockpit, and he chooses which one to inhabit.

## 2. Ger: Feeding His Family From the Back Garden in Two Years

Ger lives in a semi-detached house with a decent garden.

He has a big, simple, terrifying goal:

> “In two years, we get the majority of our veg from out that back door.”

He needs:

* Soil testing and improvement plan
* A polytunnel
* Crop rotation plans
* Season-by-season task list for his climate
* Advice from people who’ve actually done this
* Buy-in from his partner and kids

### Without TabStax

He spends winter opening random gardening blogs, watching homesteading videos, looking up polytunnels on his phone at 11pm… and then forgetting what mattered. Seasons roll past: *“Ah, we missed planting time again. Next year.”* Next year can vanish very fast.

### With TabStax

He sets up a master world: **“Back Garden – Food by 2027”**.

Inside:

* Soil analysis service open in one tab
* A spreadsheet:

  * Beds layout
  * Sun/shade notes
  * Rough crop rotation plan (Year 1 / Year 2 / Year 3)
* Shortlist of polytunnel suppliers
* A region-specific planting calendar
* A doc titled: *“What We Actually Want to Eat”* (so he doesn’t grow 10kg of kale nobody eats)

The **Start Page is explicitly seasonal**:

* **This Winter:**

  * *“Get soil test done.”*
  * *“Order polytunnel & basic tools.”*
* **Spring Year 1:**

  * *“Build beds, get compost, plant potatoes, salad, peas.”*
* **Summer Year 1:**

  * *“Keep things alive, learn, don’t overcomplicate rotation yet.”*

He also creates sub-Stax:

* **“Garden – Polytunnel Setup”**
* **“Garden – Year 1 Crops”**

He **shares the main Garden Stax with his partner**:

* They can see budget, suppliers, realistic timelines.
* They can comment “let’s skip X this year and do Y; we actually eat that.”

He also **shares a read-only version with a local gardening group or online mentor**:

* “Here’s my plan; what am I missing?”

Instead of endless vague “I’d love to be self-sufficient someday,” Ger has a literal two-year project cockpit he opens every weekend.

He is not just gardening. He’s running a quiet, deeply personal food security project — with TabStax holding the plan.

## 3. Mary, Who Acted 20 Years Ago and Buried It

Mary is in her 40s.

In her early 20s, she acted — small theatre, student films. It lit her up like nothing else.
But then life happened: a job, bills, maybe kids, safety. She buried that dream very deep.

Now, every time she sees a great performance, something inside her twists.
She knows: *if I don’t at least try again, I’ll regret this on my deathbed.*

Her real constraints:

* Time (work + life)
* Rusty skills
* Changed industry (self-tapes, online casting)
* Money
* Fear: “What if I find out I was never any good?”

### Without TabStax

She binge-watches “how to get into acting” videos, follows actors on Instagram, bookmarks local acting classes, opens Spotlight / casting sites… and never quite pulls the trigger. It feels like a fog.

### With TabStax

She creates **“Mary – Return to Acting”** Stax.

It has three main dimensions:

1. **Craft & Confidence**

   * Local acting classes pages
   * Online scene study / voice classes
   * A doc: *“Roles I’m drawn to now”*
   * A list of monologues she might love
   * Start Page Next Actions:

     * *“Email X acting studio and book an intro class.”*
     * *“Pick 1 monologue and print it.”*

2. **Career Mechanics (2025, Not 2005)**

   * Casting site(s) signup pages
   * Headshot photographers’ websites
   * Unions/agreements info for her country
   * A doc: *“Starter path: 3–6 months”*

3. **Life Architecture**

   * Calendar with realistic windows for classes / rehearsals
   * Budget sheet (headshots, classes, travel)
   * Notes shared with partner / friend: *“This is what I want and what it will cost us.”*

She **shares this Stax with one brutally honest friend or coach** and possibly her partner:

* “This is not a phase; this is what I’m actually planning.”

When she sits down to “do something about acting,” she doesn’t re-google “acting classes near me.” She **opens her Acting Stax**, where:

* Her past desire is acknowledged
* The industry reality is mapped
* The next move is written by a clear-headed version of her, not the fearful one

Even if she never becomes “famous,” she’ll know she treated the dream like a real project, not a fantasy she kept anesthetized.

## 4. Climate-Anxious Engineer Building a Local Resilience Project

He’s a software engineer who reads too much climate science to sleep well.

He knows:

* National politics is slow
* Individual lifestyle tweaks aren’t enough
* But local resilience *is* something he could influence:

  * Community solar
  * Tool libraries
  * Local food co-ops
  * Emergency prep

His brain lives in:

* Climate reports
* Mutual aid examples
* City zoning rules
* Community Facebook/Discord groups
* 1000 “we should really…” conversations

### Without TabStax

He doom-scrolls climate Twitter, shares an article, feels sick, does nothing structured. Everything feels both urgent and impossible.

### With TabStax

He defines **“Local Resilience – Project (My Town)”** Stax:

* City / town plan & climate adaptation docs
* Examples of successful local projects (tool library, co-ops, microgrids)
* A Google Doc: *“Assets & People in My Town”*
* A map with important locations (schools, community centers, flood zones)
* Slack/Discord server for the group he either joins or starts

The Start Page is deliberately narrow:

* *“Phase 1 (3 months):*

  * *Meet 5 people already doing something locally.*
  * *Pick ONE pilot project (e.g., tool library) and commit.”*

Once the pilot is chosen, he creates **a dedicated Stax for it**:

* **“Tool Library – Pilot”**

  * Examples from other cities
  * Space options
  * Cost sheet
  * Volunteer roster

He **shares Local Resilience Stax with his initial small group**, then **shares the specific project Stax** with whoever commits.

Now climate anxiety has a container. A project universe. He can schedule “Local Resilience time,” open that Stax, and work on structure, not just feelings.

## 5. Nurse on Night Shifts, Secretly Writing a Novel

She’s a nurse working rotating night shifts.

She’s also been carrying a story in her head for years — a novel based on the kinds of things she’s seen and felt, but fictionalized.

Her world:

* Shift schedules
* Exhaustion
* Emotional overflow from work
* Scraps of dialogue noted in her phone
* Word documents with half-started chapters

### Without TabStax

On a day off, she opens a Word doc called “Novel draft v3,” stares at it, then ends up doing laundry, doomscrolling, or sleeping. Her story feels like a foggy dream she keeps waking from before the ending.

### With TabStax

She creates **“Novel – Night Shift Stories”** Stax.

Inside:

* A main manuscript doc
* A separate note doc: *“Scenes, feelings, snippets”*
* A simple outline (even if messy)
* Articles / resources on “writing in small bursts”
* Calendar showing realistic writing windows between shifts

Start Page:

* *“You do NOT have to be a full-time writer.”*
* *“Goal this quarter: 3 finished chapters, no matter how bad.”*
* **Next Actions:**

  * *“Today: write one messy scene where [character] meets [patient].”*
  * *“Add 3 bullet points to outline for Act 2.”*

She **shares this Stax with no one at first** — it’s her private sanctuary.

Later, when she’s ready, she **shares it with one trusted reader or writing coach**.

When she has 40 minutes of alive brain, she doesn’t waste it looking for the right file or talking herself out of being “not a real writer.” She opens the Novel Stax and continues the story.

Over a year, that’s the difference between “I always wanted to write” and “I wrote a damn book while saving lives at night.”
