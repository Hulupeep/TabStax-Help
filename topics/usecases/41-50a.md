## 41. Emergency Vet Switching From One Crisis to the Next

It’s 7:45pm at an emergency vet clinic.

In the last hour:

* A labrador came in with suspected bloat
* A cat is on fluids after a bad fall
* A terrier is waiting for stitches
* Three anxious owners keep asking for updates

Your world is:

* Practice management software
* Lab results
* Imaging
* Drug dosage calculators
* Treatment protocols
* Whiteboard of “who’s where”

### Without TabStax

Your browser is chaos: three different patient records open, Google tabs for dosages, imaging viewer, PDF protocols. You keep flicking between them, trying not to mix up which animal has which condition. When you step into a consult room, you’re half-thinking about the last case.

### With TabStax

You’ve set up:

* **“Case – Max (Labrador, Suspected GDV)”** Stax
* **“Case – Luna (Cat, Trauma)”** Stax
* **“Case – Milo (Terrier, Laceration)”** Stax
* **“Shift – ER Overview”** Stax

Each case Stax contains:

* Patient record
* Imaging (if any)
* Lab results
* Relevant protocol tab (GDV, trauma, wound care)
* A quick structured note of **Next Actions**:

  * For Max: *“Stabilize → X-ray → prep for possible surgery”*
  * For Luna: *“Monitor vitals q15min, reassess neuro signs”*

You **share each Case Stax with the vet nurse and techs** so they know:

* What stage each patient is at
* What’s next without asking you five times

You **share the Shift Overview Stax with the receptionist** so they can give realistic updates to owners.

When you move from Max to Luna, you **close Max’s Stax** and open Luna’s:

Your brain reloads the entire story: mechanism of injury, current vitals, owner’s concerns. You bring clean attention into each treatment room, even in the chaos.

## 42. Airline Operations Controller in a Storm

You’re in the airline ops center.
A line of storms is rolling in across the region.

At once you’re dealing with:

* One flight in a holding pattern
* Another needing a diversion airport
* Crew nearing duty time limits
* Passengers missing connections

Your tools:

* Flight tracking system
* Weather radar
* Crew scheduling system
* Airport ops dashboards
* Internal chat with ground staff

### Without TabStax

You’re juggling 20 tabs and three monitors, flipping between radar, a particular flight, Slack DMs, and an Excel with crew duty times. The mental context for each flight blurs.

### With TabStax

You make:

* **“Ops – Storm System Delta (Overview)”** Stax
* **“Flight – AB123 Diversion”** Stax
* **“Flight – CD456 Crew Duty Limit Risk”** Stax

Storm Overview Stax:

* Big-picture radar
* List of affected flights
* Airport capacity info

Individual Flight Stax:

* Flight AB123 live track
* Weather + diversion airport data
* Passenger loads and connections
* Notes: *“Preferred diversion: City X (maintenance base, hotel contracts)”*

You **share Storm Overview Stax with the whole shift team** so everyone sees the same macro picture.
You **share Flight AB123 Stax with ground ops at both airports**, so they see the plan: inbound status, expected diversion time, passenger counts.

As priorities shift, you’re **opening and closing Flight Stax** like tabs of reality:

When you step into AB123 world, everything you need for that flight — not the entire airline — is right there. You make a call, update notes, close it, open the next world.

You look calm because your environment is carrying the complexity.

## 43. Construction Site Foreman Between Subcontractors, Deliveries, and Safety

You’re running a large construction site.

Right now:

* The electricians are late and blocking the drywall crew
* A steel delivery is due any minute
* There’s a safety walk with the inspector this afternoon

Your life is:

* Gantt charts
* WhatsApp groups with subcontractors
* Delivery notes
* Email threads
* Safety checklists

### Without TabStax

You’ve got the schedule open in one tab, supplier portal in another, PDFs of safety documentation buried somewhere, and three chat apps dinging. You react to whoever shouts loudest.

### With TabStax

You define:

* **“Site – Daily Control Room”** Stax
* **“Site – Electrical / Drywall Coordination (Level 3)”** Stax
* **“Site – Steel Delivery (Today)”** Stax
* **“Site – Safety Walk (Inspector)”** Stax

Control Room Stax:

* Project schedule
* Site layout
* High-level issues sheet

Coordination Stax:

* Today’s work area plan
* Messages with elec + drywall subs
* Photos of current state

Safety Stax:

* Safety checklist for the walk
* Outstanding action items from last inspection
* Relevant regs / method statements

You **share Coordination Stax with both subcontractors** so they see the same drawings and constraints.
You **share Safety Stax with the safety officer and site manager**.

When it’s time for the walk, you **open Safety Stax**, and your checklist, old actions, and documents are ready. No rummaging through email while the inspector waits.

Each Stax is like a “scene”: when you open it, you know exactly who you’re dealing with and what success looks like.

## 44. Financial Planner Running Three Client Reviews in One Morning

You’re a financial planner with back-to-back annual reviews.

* 09:00 – Couple nearing retirement
* 10:00 – Young professional focused on aggressive growth
* 11:00 – Business owner balancing company cash and personal wealth

They all need completely different conversations, numbers, and tone.

### Without TabStax

You pull up the wrong portfolio, briefly blank on what stage of life they’re in, click through the CRM while they’re on Zoom, and feel yourself warming up mid-meeting instead of starting sharp.

### With TabStax

You set up:

* **“Client – Mark & Lynda (Retirement Review)”**
* **“Client – Priya (Growth & Risk)”**
* **“Client – Alvarez Ltd. / Sofia (Business & Personal)”**

Each Stax has:

* Portfolio dashboard for that client
* CRM notes
* Plan doc
* Risk profile
* A simple Start Page:

For Mark & Lynda:

* *“Open with how they feel about slowing down work.”*
* *“Check: are they still okay selling the second property?”*

For Priya:

* *“Revisit volatility; check if last dip spooked her or not.”*

For Alvarez/Sofia:

* *“Clarify what’s business buffer vs personal investment; highlight tax angles.”*

You **share each Stax with your paraplanner/admin**:

* They prep notes and update follow-up tasks in the same environment.

After the 9:00 call, you close that entire life story, and **open Priya’s Stax** — now you’re in “single, career, growth” headspace, not “couple, security, legacy”.

Clients feel it. You’re present, not generic.

## 45. Dungeon Master Running Multiple Campaigns

You DM games for three different groups:

* A gritty low-magic campaign on Tuesdays
* A high-chaos, meme-filled group on Thursdays
* A serious long-form story you’ve been running for years

Each has:

* World map
* NPCs
* Ongoing plots
* Player backstories
* Encounter notes

### Without TabStax

Your browser has five different D&D Beyond tabs, three map tools, fifteen random “name generator” tabs, and session notes buried in Docs. You show up on Thursday remembering Tuesday’s plot twist.

### With TabStax

You build:

* **“Campaign – Greybridge (Tuesdays)”**
* **“Campaign – Goblin TikTok (Thursdays)”**
* **“Campaign – The Iron Dominion (Sundays)”**

Each Stax includes:

* Campaign notes
* Character sheets
* Encounter builder
* Map
* Playlist or ambience tab
* A Start Page with:

For Greybridge:

* *“Tonight: reveal the traitor in the guild.”*

For Goblin TikTok:

* *“Lean into chaos; give them a ridiculous magic item.”*

For Iron Dominion:

* *“Advance the war; show consequences of last session’s choice.”*

You **share each Stax with your players** (or a player-facing version):

* They open it and see the map, recap, and key NPCs.

Before each session, you open the right Stax and instantly re-enter that world — tone, stakes, threads.
Your players feel like you’ve been thinking only about *their* story all week.

## 46. Veterinary Clinic Owner Balancing Patients, Staff, and Business

You own a busy vet clinic.

Your roles:

* Vet seeing appointments
* Manager dealing with staff rota and HR
* Owner watching the books, marketing, and growth

Each mode uses different tools:

* Clinical software, radiology, labs
* Scheduling system, HR docs
* Accounting, bank, social media, Google reviews

### Without TabStax

You have everything half-open all day: x-rays next to payroll, Facebook ads next to lab results. You stay in a fuzzy, stressed “everything at once” state.

### With TabStax

You carve out:

* **“Clinic – Consult Room Mode”** Stax
* **“Clinic – Staff & HR”** Stax
* **“Clinic – Business & Growth”** Stax

Consult Stax:

* EHR
* Lab portal
* Imaging viewer
* Client education resources

Staff & HR Stax:

* Rota
* HR documents
* Staff feedback forms

Business Stax:

* Accounting
* POS reports
* Marketing tools

You **share Staff & HR Stax with your practice manager**, and **Business Stax with your accountant / marketing helper**.

During consult blocks, you live only in Consult Stax. When it’s time to think about the business, you close that and open Business Stax — your brain swaps “this animal, this family” for “this business, this month”.

## 47. Penetration Tester Handling Two Engagements Plus Reporting

You’re a pentester.

Today you’re:

* Finalizing tests on a **fintech API**
* Starting recon on a **manufacturing company’s external perimeter**
* Writing the **final report** for a third client

Each engagement has scopes, tools, notes, and findings.

### Without TabStax

Your browser is full of Burp, recon tools, notes, Jira tickets, PDFs of scopes, and you risk mixing up credentials or URLs between clients — a big no-no.

### With TabStax

You define:

* **“Engagement – FintechCo API”**
* **“Engagement – ManuCorp Perimeter”**
* **“Reporting – RetailBank Web App”**

Each Engagement Stax includes:

* Scope document
* Tool dashboards
* Target URLs
* Notes of findings with severity
* Client communication channel

The Reporting Stax:

* Report template
* Evidence screenshots folder
* Findings summary doc
* Risk rating references

You **share each Engagement Stax internally with your security team lead**.
You **share nothing cross-client**, keeping worlds totally separate and contained.

When you work on FintechCo, you **open that Stax only**, knowing you’re inside the right scope.
When you move to ManuCorp, you close FintechCo completely and open ManuCorp. No chance of accidental cross-contamination.

You’re faster *and* safer.

## 48. University Lecturer Split Between Teaching, Research, and Admin

You’re a lecturer.

Today:

* Morning lecture for 2nd years
* Afternoon office hours
* Evening: work on a research paper revision
* Somewhere in between: respond to a pile of admin emails

Different mental spaces:

* Teaching mode
* 1:1 student support
* Deep research & writing
* Bureaucratic checklist hell

### Without TabStax

Your browser holds lecture slides, Moodle, email, journal submission portal, spreadsheets, Teams, and three random PDFs. You carry the admin frustration into your lecture and the student stories into your writing block.

### With TabStax

You create:

* **“Teaching – 2nd Year Algorithms (Week 6)”** Stax
* **“Students – Office Hours (Today)”** Stax
* **“Research – Paper Revision: Graph Models”** Stax
* **“Admin – Emails & Forms”** Stax

Teaching Stax:

* Slides
* Code examples
* LMS page
* Q&A doc

Office Hours Stax:

* List of students with notes
* Their project docs
* Gradebook

Research Stax:

* Draft paper
* Reviewer comments
* Relevant papers
* Notes of what to fix

Admin Stax:

* Email
* University portals
* Form docs

You **share Teaching Stax with your TA**.
You **share Research Stax with your co-author**.
You might **share Office Hours Stax with an academic advisor** if they co-support students.

When it’s time to teach, you open only Teaching Stax.
When you sit down at night to revise, you close Admin, open Research, and let your brain sink into the theory, not the forms.

## 49. Genealogy Hobbyist Piecing Together a Family Line

It’s Saturday night and you’re deep in your family tree.

You’re chasing the Byrne line back through:

* Census scans
* Parish records
* Passenger lists
* DNA matches
* Old family photos someone uploaded once

### Without TabStax

You open 25 tabs from Ancestry/MyHeritage, a map, a notes doc, and get hopelessly lost: “Which Patrick Byrne am I looking at? Was this the one from Boston or Liverpool?”

### With TabStax

You create:

* **“Family Line – Byrne (Galway → US)”** Stax
* **“Family Line – Murphy (Cork)”** if needed

Byrne Stax has:

* Tree view focused on the relevant branch
* Census records tabs you’re comparing side by side
* Passenger list for likely matches
* Notes doc:

  * *“Patrick b. 1884: likely match with ship record from 1905 – check father’s name.”*
* A Start Page with questions you’re trying to answer this session.

You **share the Byrne Stax with a cousin who's also obsessed**.

They open it and see:

* Exactly which records you’re weighing
* Your working theories
* Links to the documents

Next time you come back — whether it’s a week or a month — you open Byrne Stax and your investigation restarts exactly where your last brain left off.

## 50. Parent Planning a Multi-Country Trip With Their Partner

You’re planning a summer trip with your partner and kids.

It’s complicated:

* Flights into one city, out of another
* Trains between two countries
* Airbnbs and hotels
* Things to do that work for both adults and kids
* Budget you don’t want to blow

### Without TabStax

You screenshot things, send each other random links on WhatsApp, have 40 tabs open with “maybe” ideas, and constantly ask, “Where was that cool apartment you found?”

### With TabStax

You spin up:

* **“Trip – Summer 2026 (Master Stax)”**
* Optional sub-Stax:

  * **“Trip – City 1 (3 days)”**
  * **“Trip – Lakes / Mountains”**

Master Trip Stax includes:

* Flights search
* Train timetables
* Accommodation options
* Shared Google Sheet for budget
* Map with pinned locations
* Start Page with:

  * *“Lock flights by Sunday”*
  * *“Decide between Option A (cheaper, fewer days) vs Option B (longer, more $$).”*

You **share this Stax with your partner**.

They open it and see **the same**:

* Options
* Notes
* Budget

When it’s “trip planning time,” you both open the Trip Stax — maybe on different devices in the same room — and make decisions from a single shared context instead of juggling 15 threads.

The planning itself stops being a chore and starts feeling like collaborating inside a shared mind.
