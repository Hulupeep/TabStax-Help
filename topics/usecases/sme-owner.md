# SME Owner Running the Business From 6 Different Apps

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You run a small design studio: **BrightPixel Studio**.

Your daily operating stack:

* Invoicing (Xero)
* Bank portal
* Project tracker (Trello/Asana)
* Email
* Figma
* WhatsApp Web for client messages
* Social media for leads

## Without TabStax

Every morning is a "rebuild ops view" exercise. You open things in random order, miss an invoice, forget which client is overdue, and lose half an hour to getting oriented.

## With TabStax

You create **"BrightPixel – Daily Ops"** Stax:

* All core tools in one saved state
* A Start Page with:

  * *"1. Check overdue invoices in Xero"*
  * *"2. Review today's tasks in Asana"*
  * *"3. Respond to client pings (WhatsApp, Email)"*
  * *"4. 10 mins on lead gen (LinkedIn/Twitter)"*

Every morning:

* You open that Stax.
* The business control panel snaps into view.
* You follow your own sequence.

You also have:

* **"Client – Atlas Retail Website"** Stax
* **"Client – Nova Branding"** Stax

Each has just the tabs for that project: Figma, doc, email thread.

When you switch clients, you:

* Close one Stax.
* Open the other.
* Your brain doesn't have to drag context across — it's already there.

You can **share individual client Stax with freelancers or staff**:

* They see the live tools, not just some vague brief.

**Outcome:** Running the business feels like opening "Ops Mode" and "Client Mode" on demand — not juggling spaghetti.
