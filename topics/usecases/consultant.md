# Consultant With Three Clients and No Time

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

You're in the middle of finishing an insight pack for **Lighting Brothers**.

* You've got:

  * A Google Doc with the analysis
  * Their last email with questions
  * A Looker/PowerBI dashboard
  * Their website and competitor sites
  * A notes page with key recommendations

You're tweaking one last chart. The email with your deck needs to go out in **2 minutes**.

In **5 minutes**, you're due on a Zoom call with **the Swedish Department of Education** about a completely different topic and stack of tools.

## Without TabStax

You finish the Lighting Brothers deck, scramble to find the Zoom link for Sweden, try to remember where you left your notes, close the wrong tabs, reopen others, and start the call already mentally out of breath.

## With TabStax

You've already set things up:

* **Stax 1: "Lighting Brothers – Q3 Analysis"** includes:

  * Deck in Google Docs
  * BI dashboard
  * Email thread
  * Notes doc
  * Their website / competitors
  * A Start Page with Next Actions like:

    * *"Export final chart to slide 7"*
    * *"Send summary email with 3 key bullets"*

* **Stax 2: "Swedish Dept of Education – Pilot Call"** includes:

  * Zoom meeting link
  * Agenda doc
  * Research on their existing systems
  * Your internal prep notes
  * A Start Page with:

    * *"Open with 2-minute recap of last meeting"*
    * *"Ask about scope constraints"*

Here's the move:

1. You're in **Lighting Brothers Stax**.

   * You tick off your final Next Action.
   * Export the chart, drop it into the deck.
   * Hit send on the email.
   * Mark the Stax as "Done for now".

2. **Two minutes before** the Swedish call:

   * You hit **Open Stax → "Swedish Dept of Education – Pilot Call"**.
   * Zoom opens.
   * Agenda is loaded.
   * Your last notes are in front of you.
   * The Start Page is literally reminding you *how to start the conversation*.

You join the call calm, not scrambling.

If you're working with a colleague:

* You **share the Swedish Stax** with them.
* They open it and instantly see the same agenda, research, and notes you're using.

**Outcome:** You switch from one client universe to another in under 10 seconds, with full confidence you haven't left anything behind.
