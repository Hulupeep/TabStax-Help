 #Tabstax use cases
---

## 1. Consultant With Three Clients and No Time (Lighting Brothers / Swedish Dept of Education)

You’re in the middle of finishing an insight pack for **Lighting Brothers**.

* You’ve got:

  * A Google Doc with the analysis
  * Their last email with questions
  * A Looker/PowerBI dashboard
  * Their website and competitor sites
  * A notes page with key recommendations

You’re tweaking one last chart. The email with your deck needs to go out in **2 minutes**.

In **5 minutes**, you’re due on a Zoom call with **the Swedish Department of Education** about a completely different topic and stack of tools.

### Without TabStax

You finish the Lighting Brothers deck, scramble to find the Zoom link for Sweden, try to remember where you left your notes, close the wrong tabs, reopen others, and start the call already mentally out of breath.

### With TabStax

You’ve already set things up:

* **Stax 1: “Lighting Brothers – Q3 Analysis”** includes:

  * Deck in Google Docs
  * BI dashboard
  * Email thread
  * Notes doc
  * Their website / competitors
  * A Start Page with Next Actions like:

    * *“Export final chart to slide 7”*
    * *“Send summary email with 3 key bullets”*

* **Stax 2: “Swedish Dept of Education – Pilot Call”** includes:

  * Zoom meeting link
  * Agenda doc
  * Research on their existing systems
  * Your internal prep notes
  * A Start Page with:

    * *“Open with 2-minute recap of last meeting”*
    * *“Ask about scope constraints”*

Here’s the move:

1. You’re in **Lighting Brothers Stax**.

   * You tick off your final Next Action.
   * Export the chart, drop it into the deck.
   * Hit send on the email.
   * Mark the Stax as “Done for now”.

2. **Two minutes before** the Swedish call:

   * You hit **Open Stax → “Swedish Dept of Education – Pilot Call”**.
   * Zoom opens.
   * Agenda is loaded.
   * Your last notes are in front of you.
   * The Start Page is literally reminding you *how to start the conversation*.

You join the call calm, not scrambling.

If you’re working with a colleague:

* You **share the Swedish Stax** with them.
* They open it and instantly see the same agenda, research, and notes you’re using.

**Outcome:** You switch from one client universe to another in under 10 seconds, with full confidence you haven’t left anything behind.

## 2. Neurodivergent Builder With 5 Parallel Projects (ADHD, Hyperfocus, No Thrash)

You have:

* A Chrome extension you’re building
* A book you’re editing
* A small AI tool spinning up
* A landing page experiment
* A client advisory gig

Your brain wants to go deep… but the **setup cost** of getting back into each thing kills you.

### Without TabStax

You bounce between random tabs, lose the “world state” of each project, and every return feels like starting from zero. Half your energy is spent remembering what you were doing.

### With TabStax

Each project gets its own **world**:

* **“TabStax MVP – Build”**
* **“Book – Chapter 4 Editing”**
* **“AI Tool – ClaimAlert Experiments”**
* **“Landing Page Tests – May”**
* **“Client – Advisory Retainer X”**

Inside each:

* The exact tabs you need for *that* mode: editor, docs, analytics, email, notes.
* A Start Page with **3–5 concrete Next Actions** that you wrote when you last left it.

When your focus shifts:

* You close the current Stax.
* You hit **Open Stax → “Book – Chapter 4 Editing”**.
* Your manuscript, references, and last edit notes pop up.
* The Start Page says:

  * *“Fix section on TabStax use cases”*
  * *“Tighten intro paragraph”*

You’re not “figuring out what to do”. You’re simply **continuing**.

If you collaborate (editor, dev, designer):

* You **share the relevant Stax** with them.
* They step into the same world you operate in — not a random link bundle.

**Outcome:** Each context is a saveable, reloadable “brain state”. Hyperfocus becomes a weapon, not a liability.

## 3. Sales Rep Chasing a Whale Account (Team + Client Sharing)

You’re working a big enterprise prospect: **NordicGrid Energy**.

You’ve got:

* CRM opportunity page
* LinkedIn accounts for champion + blockers
* Email chains
* Proposal deck in progress
* A competitor pricing sheet
* Internal Slack thread
* Call recordings from discovery

### Without TabStax

Before each interaction, you hunt: where’s that deck, what did they say about budget, which competitor are they evaluating again?

### With TabStax

You’ve created **“NordicGrid – Deal Cycle”** Stax:

* All research, CRM, docs, and call recaps in one persistent environment
* Start Page Next Actions like:

  * *“Clarify renewal timeline”*
  * *“Align pricing with energy usage tiers”*

Before the next call:

* Open Stax → **“NordicGrid – Deal Cycle”**
* All tabs are instantly live.
* Your own notes about the last call are front and center.
* The deck opens on the right slide.

Then you **share the Stax internally**:

* Pre-sales engineer adds a technical FAQ tab.
* Your VP adds an “Exec Summary” draft.
* Marketing adds a case study.

Optionally, you create a **“NordicGrid – Shared Materials”** Stax just for the client:

* Proposal PDF
* ROI calculator
* Case studies
* Implementation timeline

You share that link with the client. Now both sides are literally looking at the same curated space.

**Outcome:** Every time you touch this account, you’re stepping into a fully-loaded war room, not reconstructing it from memory.

## 4. Scrum Master With a Standup That Can Run Without Them

You run daily standup for **Team Falcon**.

Your “standup cockpit” usually includes:

* Jira board in the exact column view you use
* Sprint Goal page
* Bug list filtered to “today’s issues”
* CI/CD status page
* A short script / checklist for running standup

### Without TabStax

When you’re sick or late, the team freestyles. Standup loses structure, and new members are confused.

### With TabStax

You create **“Team Falcon – Standup Stax”**:

* All the above tabs saved
* Start Page with:

  * *“Step 1: Revisit Sprint Goal”*
  * *“Step 2: Yesterday / Today / Blockers”*
  * *“Step 3: Check critical bugs”*

You **share the Stax with the whole team**.

On any given morning:

* You open Stax → everything you need is arranged exactly how you like it.
* If you’re out, someone else clicks the same Stax link.
* The board, the checklist, and priorities are identical.

**Outcome:** Your process becomes a reusable kit. Standup is a system, not a personality.

## 5. ND Parent With School Chaos and Shared Mental Load

You’ve got a child in school and the usual mess:

* School app / portal
* Emails about trips, uniforms, events
* Payment links
* Calendar of random one-off days
* A running checklist of “things to remember for Thursday”

### Without TabStax

Stuff slips. One parent ends up carrying all the mental load. You scramble the morning of the school play.

### With TabStax

You create **“Rory – School Admin (This Term)”** Stax:

* School portal
* Payment pages
* Shared Google Doc: “School To-Dos”
* Calendar in the right view

Start Page Next Actions:

* *“Pay for class trip – deadline Fri”*
* *“Buy new tracksuit bottoms”*
* *“Note parent-teacher time slot”*

You **share this Stax with your co-parent**.

Now:

* Either of you can open the Stax and see everything that needs attention.
* Whoever acts just ticks off the next action and updates the doc.
* On big days (school play, sports day), you open the Stax and instantly see the logistics instead of sweeping through old emails.

**Outcome:** The mental model of “school admin” becomes a shared workspace, not one person’s overloaded memory.

## 6. SME Owner Running the Business From 6 Different Apps

You run a small design studio: **BrightPixel Studio**.

Your daily operating stack:

* Invoicing (Xero)
* Bank portal
* Project tracker (Trello/Asana)
* Email
* Figma
* WhatsApp Web for client messages
* Social media for leads

### Without TabStax

Every morning is a “rebuild ops view” exercise. You open things in random order, miss an invoice, forget which client is overdue, and lose half an hour to getting oriented.

### With TabStax

You create **“BrightPixel – Daily Ops”** Stax:

* All core tools in one saved state
* A Start Page with:

  * *“1. Check overdue invoices in Xero”*
  * *“2. Review today’s tasks in Asana”*
  * *“3. Respond to client pings (WhatsApp, Email)”*
  * *“4. 10 mins on lead gen (LinkedIn/Twitter)”*

Every morning:

* You open that Stax.
* The business control panel snaps into view.
* You follow your own sequence.

You also have:

* **“Client – Atlas Retail Website”** Stax
* **“Client – Nova Branding”** Stax

Each has just the tabs for that project: Figma, doc, email thread.

When you switch clients, you:

* Close one Stax.
* Open the other.
* Your brain doesn’t have to drag context across — it’s already there.

You can **share individual client Stax with freelancers or staff**:

* They see the live tools, not just some vague brief.

**Outcome:** Running the business feels like opening “Ops Mode” and “Client Mode” on demand — not juggling spaghetti.

## 7. Corporate Manager Living in 12 SaaS Tools All Day

You’re a manager in a big company. Your days are:

* Calendar hell
* Jira / Asana / internal tools
* 3 dashboards
* Email + Teams/Slack
* Docs for each project
* Constant 30-minute context cuts

### Without TabStax

Each meeting requires hunting: “Where are the notes? Where’s the dashboard? What did we decide last time?”

### With TabStax

You have:

* **“Team – Weekly Leadership Meeting”** Stax
* **“Project – Platform Revamp”** Stax
* **“Project – Cost Optimisation”** Stax

Each Stax includes:

* Agenda doc
* Notes
* The right dashboard
* Relevant Jira board
* Key email thread

Before a meeting:

* You hit **Open Stax → “Project – Platform Revamp”**.
* By the time the video call connects, your tools and last notes are ready.

Between meetings:

* You close that Stax.
* Open **“Cost Optimisation”**.
* New dashboards, new notes, new context — instantly.

You **share each Stax with the project team**:

* They join the call with the same context open already.

**Outcome:** You switch projects with the same ease you switch tabs, but the *entire context* comes along.

## 8. DevOps Responding to a Production Incident

PagerDuty goes off.

For this type of incident, you usually need:

* Grafana / Datadog dashboards
* Logs
* Deployment pipeline
* Feature flag console
* Runbook doc
* Incident Slack/Teams channel

### Without TabStax

You burn 5–10 minutes just spinning everything up and pasting links around.

### With TabStax

You already prepared **“P1 – Web Latency / Errors”** Stax:

* All relevant dashboards with the right filters
* The runbook opened at the exact section
* CI/CD panel
* Comms channel

You hit **Open Stax → “P1 – Web Latency / Errors”** and you’re in the cockpit.

You **share that Stax in the incident channel**:

* On-call devs and managers click the same link.
* Everyone instantly sees the same dashboards and runbook instructions — no “please share link?” spam.

**Outcome:** Context switching from “regular work” to “incident mode” is a single action, not an adrenaline-fuelled scavenger hunt.

## 9. Emergency Manager Handling a Gas Leak With Multiple Agencies

There’s a gas leak reported in a residential area.

To manage it, you need:

* Live map of the area
* Utility provider dashboard
* Weather data
* 911 / emergency call feed
* Evacuation procedures doc
* Media / press release template
* Internal comms platform

### Without TabStax

You’re firing links to fire brigade, police, utilities, press office separately. Everyone builds their own tab mess.

### With TabStax

You have **“Incident – Gas Leak (Zone A)”** Stax ready:

* All core tools, maps, procedures
* Start Page with a step list:

  * *“1. Confirm leak location and radius”*
  * *“2. Trigger evacuation”*
  * *“3. Notify media with pre-approved template”*

You **share that Stax link** with:

* Fire / emergency responders
* Utility operator
* Press officer
* City leadership

Each stakeholder opens one link and gets the same operational picture.

**Outcome:** You’re not just sending links — you’re distributing a ready-made **command environment**.

## 10. Personal Finances & Taxes – With an Accountant in the Loop

It’s tax time.

You’ve got:

* Revenue/ROS login
* Bank statements
* Expense tracking sheet
* Pension docs
* Receipts in Drive
* Email thread with your accountant

### Without TabStax

You re-open these every time you work on taxes, then lose them, then forward random info to your accountant.

### With TabStax

You make **“2024 – Tax Prep”** Stax:

* All relevant portals and docs
* Start Page Next Actions like:

  * *“Upload missing receipts”*
  * *“Check health expenses eligibility”*
  * *“Confirm pension contributions total”*

Every time you give it 20 minutes:

* You open that one Stax.
* Continue from the next action.
* Nothing gets lost.

Then you **share the Stax with your accountant**:

* They open it and see the same portals, docs, and structure you’ve been using.
* They can say “log into this, click that, check this” while knowing exactly what’s on your screen.

**Outcome:** Tax prep becomes a guided workflow with a shared cockpit, not miscellaneous chaos across email and downloads.
