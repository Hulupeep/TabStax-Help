# Mary, Who Acted 20 Years Ago and Buried It

[← Back to Use Cases](index.md)

---

Mary is in her 40s.

In her early 20s, she acted — small theatre, student films. It lit her up like nothing else.
But then life happened: a job, bills, maybe kids, safety. She buried that dream very deep.

Now, every time she sees a great performance, something inside her twists.
She knows: *if I don't at least try again, I'll regret this on my deathbed.*

Her real constraints:

* Time (work + life)
* Rusty skills
* Changed industry (self-tapes, online casting)
* Money
* Fear: "What if I find out I was never any good?"

## Without TabStax

She binge-watches "how to get into acting" videos, follows actors on Instagram, bookmarks local acting classes, opens Spotlight / casting sites… and never quite pulls the trigger. It feels like a fog.

## With TabStax

She creates **"Mary – Return to Acting"** Stax.

It has three main dimensions:

1. **Craft & Confidence**

   * Local acting classes pages
   * Online scene study / voice classes
   * A doc: *"Roles I'm drawn to now"*
   * A list of monologues she might love
   * Start Page Next Actions:

     * *"Email X acting studio and book an intro class."*
     * *"Pick 1 monologue and print it."*

2. **Career Mechanics (2025, Not 2005)**

   * Casting site(s) signup pages
   * Headshot photographers' websites
   * Unions/agreements info for her country
   * A doc: *"Starter path: 3–6 months"*

3. **Life Architecture**

   * Calendar with realistic windows for classes / rehearsals
   * Budget sheet (headshots, classes, travel)
   * Notes shared with partner / friend: *"This is what I want and what it will cost us."*

She **shares this Stax with one brutally honest friend or coach** and possibly her partner:

* "This is not a phase; this is what I'm actually planning."

When she sits down to "do something about acting," she doesn't re-google "acting classes near me." She **opens her Acting Stax**, where:

* Her past desire is acknowledged
* The industry reality is mapped
* The next move is written by a clear-headed version of her, not the fearful one

Even if she never becomes "famous," she'll know she treated the dream like a real project, not a fantasy she kept anesthetized.
