# What is a Stax?

A **Stax** is a *space where you get things done*.

It’s all the websites you use together for a task or project —
**documentation, dashboards, tools, videos, briefs, emails, boards** —
plus your **next actions** and **little bits of context** that tell your brain:

> “This is where we left off. Pick up here.”

One click, and you’re back where your mind left off.

It’s **not** a tab manager.
It’s a **flow manager**.

---

## The simple definition (mental model)

Think of a Stax as:

* **A named workspace** for one thing you’re doing

  > “Team Alpha Standups”, “Client X Launch”, “My PhD Writing Session”
* **A bundle of tabs** that actually belong together
* **Next actions + notes** that keep your brain oriented

Instead of a pile of random tabs, you have **one Stax per flow**.

---

## Why Stax exist (and why your brain likes them)

Your brain does a ton of work just to *rebuild context*:

* “Where’s the doc?”
* “What dashboard was I using?”
* “What were we waiting on?”

Normal tabs and bookmarks don’t remember any of that for you.

A Stax does:

* **Rebuilds your setup** → all the websites you use for that thing
* **Reminds you of your next moves** → *Next actions* live right beside the tabs
* **Keeps the story** → short notes like “We’re blocked on Sarah’s approval”

So when you open a Stax, your brain doesn’t have to *re-boot* the project.
You just step back into the flow.

## If you received a Stax link

If someone shared a Stax with you (via a link or share page), it means:

* They’ve **captured how they work** on something into one Stax
* They’re inviting you to **join them in that space**
* You now see **the same tabs, same structure, same context**

You’re not inside their browser; you’re sharing the **same working room**.

### What that means for collaboration

Receiving a Stax is someone saying:

> “Here’s the exact setup I use to work on this. Let’s stand in the same place.”

You can:

* Open the tabs they use
* See the structure they set up
* (With the extension) **save your own copy** and adapt it to your flow

Depending on the Stax and your plan, you might also see **live updates** when they add or change things — so you stay in sync.

## Concrete examples – how people use Stax together

Here are a few mental models to make it real.

### 1. Scrum Master with multiple teams

You’re a scrum master running three squads.

You might have:

* **“Team Alpha – Rituals Stax”**

  * Jira board
  * Sprint doc
  * Retro board
  * Team dashboard
  * Next actions: “Check blockers before standup”, “Review carry-over stories”

* **“Team Beta – Planning Stax”**

  * Product spec
  * Roadmap tool
  * Estimates sheet
  * Next actions: “Align with PO on Q2 scope”

* **“Team Gamma – Incident Follow-up Stax”**

  * Incident doc
  * Logs dashboard
  * Comms doc
  * Next actions: “Draft incident summary”, “Schedule incident review”

You share the Stax with each team so when they open it, everyone is literally **looking at the same tabs, same flow, same next actions**.

---

### 2. Client onboarding as a freelancer/consultant

You’re onboarding a new client.

Your **“Client Onboarding – Company Y” Stax** might have:

* The signed contract
* Your kickoff notes
* Their Notion/Confluence space
* Their analytics dashboard
* A doc with “Questions to confirm”

Next actions might be:

* “Prepare kickoff agenda”
* “List data sources we’ll need access to”

Share that Stax with the client. Now you both sit in the same shared workspace for onboarding instead of emailing links back and forth.

---

### 3. Studying or exam prep

You’re revising for an exam or learning a new topic.

Your **“Biology Exam – Cell Division Stax”** might have:

* School portal page
* Key YouTube explainer
* Past exam questions
* Flashcard app page

Next actions:

* “Do 3 past questions on mitosis”
* “Re-watch explanation of meiosis errors”

Share that Stax with a study buddy → you’re literally revising from the *same* resources in the *same* flow.

---

### 4. Planning a trip together

You’re planning a city break with a friend or partner.

Your **“Paris Weekend Stax”** might have:

* Flight search
* Hotel options
* Restaurant lists
* Google Maps with saved locations
* Shared note with rough plan

Next actions:

* “Decide hotel by Friday”
* “Book dinner for Saturday night”

Share the Stax; now you’re both tweaking the same plan, not sending scattered links on WhatsApp.

---

## What you can do when you open a Stax

On the **share page** (no extension needed):

* See the **Stax name & description**
* Browse the **list of tabs**
* Open individual tabs or **open them all**
* Get a feel for how the sender works on this thing

With the **TabStax extension installed**:

* Save that Stax into **your collection**
* Edit the tabs (add/remove)
* Add your own **next actions and notes**
* Use it as a **template** and duplicate it for other projects

Once you save it, it becomes **your Stax**. Your edits don’t change the original.

---

## Safety & trust – should you open this Stax?

A Stax is a **bundle of links plus notes**. Treat it like you would any link someone sends you.

### Ask yourself:

1. **Do I know who shared this?**

   * From your team / friend / known creator → usually fine, as with any shared doc.
   * From a stranger or random site → be cautious.

2. **Do the links look sane?**

   * You can see each domain on the share page.
   * Open a couple of tabs first instead of everything at once.
   * Avoid anything that looks like a phishing page or weird download.

### What TabStax *doesn’t* do

* It **doesn’t run code on your machine** by itself — it just opens URLs in your browser.
* It **doesn’t see your passwords** — your logins stay handled by your browser and sites.
* It **doesn’t bypass browser security** — all your usual protections still apply.

If you wouldn’t trust a random link from someone, don’t trust a random Stax from them either.

---

## TL;DR

* A **Stax** is your **flow space**: tabs + next actions + context for one thing you're doing.
* It's not a tab manager. It's a **flow manager** that puts you back *exactly* where your mind left off.
* When someone shares a Stax with you, they're inviting you to work in the **same space**: same tabs, same structure, same context.
* You can open it in any browser, and with the extension, save it, edit it, and make it your own.
