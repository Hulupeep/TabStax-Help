# What you see the first time you open TabStax

You've just installed TabStax, pinned it to your browser toolbar, and clicked the icon. This is the very first screen you'll see. It's designed to capture your current browser window—all the tabs you have open right now—and save them as your **first Stax**. This gives you a safe, named workspace you can return to anytime.

## Pin TabStax and open the popup

After installing the TabStax extension:

1. **Pin the TabStax icon** to your browser toolbar (usually in the top-right corner near other extensions).
2. **Click the icon** to open the popup.
3. The first-time view appears, showing your current tabs ready to become a Stax.

## Your current window, ready to become a Stax

The main section shows a card that says:

> **👋 No stax yet — let's create your first one!**

Below that, you'll see a **list of your currently open tabs** (for example: TabStax Help pages, Gmail, research tabs, whatever you have open right now).

**What this means:**

TabStax is looking at your current browser window and treating it as a potential workspace. These tabs aren't random—they're probably related to something you're doing right now. TabStax is offering to save them all together so you can come back to this exact setup later.

## Naming your first Stax (and tags)

At the bottom of the popup, there's an **input field** pre-filled with a suggested name, like:

```
My First Stax #test
```

**You can change this** to anything that describes what these tabs are for:
- `Christmas Shopping 2025`
- `Work Project - Q1 Report #clients`
- `Learning React #dev #tutorials`

**Tags** (the words starting with `#`) are just **keywords** that help you categorize and quickly find your Stax later. They're completely optional, but helpful when you have many Stax.

## What happens when you click New

When you're ready to save this workspace:

1. **Check the name and tags** in the input field (edit if needed).
2. **Click the "New" button**.
3. TabStax saves all your currently open tabs together as a **Stax** under that name.
4. A **Start Page** opens where you can add your **next actions** for this workspace (what you need to do next when you come back to this work).

**After that:**

- **Auto-save:** If you add or remove tabs while working in this Stax, TabStax automatically keeps it updated.
- **Close safely:** You can confidently close all these tabs (or the whole window) when you're done. Your Stax is saved.
- **Reopen anytime:** Later, when you want to pick up this work again:
  - Open the TabStax popup
  - Find this Stax in "My Stax"
  - Click **"Open All"**
  - All your tabs reopen together, and your next actions appear at the top

You step back into the same workspace instead of hunting through browser history or trying to remember what you had open.

## Now you can…

Now you can stash this whole workspace with one click and trust it'll be there when you're ready to pick up again—no more losing track of tabs or forgetting where you left off.
